MacOS X notes

   This is a full featured native MacOS X port.



@heading
Required software

   To build Allegro under MacOS X, you need:

      <ul><li>MacOS X 10.2.x or newer
      <li>Apple Developer Tools (December 2002 or newer edition)</ul>

   If you don't have the Developer Tools installed, you can get the
   latest release at:
<blockquote>
      <link>http://developer.apple.com/tools/download</a>
</blockquote>
   On the same page you will also find instructions on how to install them.
   Note that system version 10.2.x is required to compile Allegro, but
   the library will still work on 10.1.x. (At least that was true once; we
   haven't gone back and checked it!)



@heading
Installing Allegro

   Allegro ships in source code form; this means you need to compile it
   before you can use it. You do this easily from a terminal window.
   See the generic documentation in docs/build/cmake.txt.

   You may build either Unix-style shared library, or Mac OS X frameworks,
   or both.

Using Allegro from the command line

   The options for linking with Allegro are quite long, expecially for
   static versions of the library as you need to pull in several different
   frameworks (Cocoa, QuickTime, etc.) other than Allegro itself. When
   linking against the shared library version, things are also different.
   To avoid you having to work out the right linker commands for yourself,
   the installation creates a script, <tt>allegro-config</tt>, that will print out a
   suitable commandline. You can use this inside a backtick command
   substitution, for example:
<textblock>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs`
<endblock>
   Or if you want to build a debug version of your program, assuming that 
   you have installed the debug version of Allegro:
<textblock>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --libs debug`
<endblock>
   You can also link against the Allegro framework, providing you previously
   installed it:
<textblock>
      gcc myfile.c -o myprogram `allegro-config --frameworks`
<endblock>
   Unix newbies, take note that these are ` backticks, not normal ' quotes!

   There are also switches for printing out the Allegro version number, 
   overriding the install paths, and selecting between shared and static 
   libraries, in case you installed both. Run <tt>allegro-config</tt> without any
   arguments for a full list of options.

   If you get an error like '<tt>allegro-config: program not found</tt>', and
   you're sure you have built and installed the library as described above, it
   probably means that <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> is not on your path. The method
   to add it depends on the shell you're using. If you have tcsh, add the
   following line to the end of the <tt>.cshrc</tt> in your home directory.
<textblock>
     set path=($path /usr/local/bin)
<endblock>
   If you have bash, add the following line to the end of the <tt>.bash_profile</tt>
   file in your home directory:
<textblock>
     PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
<endblock>
   If you don't know which, just type <tt>echo $SHELL</tt> on the command 
   line, which will print either <tt>/bin/bash</tt> or <tt>/bin/tcsh</tt>.
   Newer versions of OSX use bash, older ones use tcsh.
   You will have to close the Terminal window and open a new one once
   you have made the changes, so it will have an effect.



@heading
Allegro and application bundles

   When you build applications from the command line, you're actually just
   creating the executable, so you can run it from the command line only,
   and not also from the finder like a common MacOS X application. In other
   words, compiling from the command line does not create application
   bundles.

   Allegro ships with a little tool, named fixbundle, which allows to build
   an application bundle out of an executable.
   The utility works from the command line and it accepts a variety of
   options to customize your bundle; the easiest way to use it is:
<textblock>
      fixbundle executable_name
<endblock>
   This will create an application bundle named "<tt>executable_name.app</tt>" that
   contains your program executable and will appear in the finder with the
   default application icon. A more complex usage example follows:
<textblock>
      fixbundle executable_name -m -o bundle_name -v "1.2" icon.bmp
<endblock>
   This creates a bundle named "<tt>bundle_name.app</tt>". The executable will be
   moved instead of copied into the bundle; the application will be marked
   as version "1.2" and icon.bmp will be converted to an icon for the
   bundle. You can specify more options and up to 4 differently sized
   icons (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 and 128x128) to be read from any Allegro
   supported image files or from datafile objects.
   Run fixbundle without arguments for the full list of known options.

   A special note is required for the "<tt>-e</tt>" switch; this lets you embed
   the Allegro framework inside the built application bundle, so your
   app will not require Allegro to be installed into the target machine
   in order to work. This flag assumes you previously installed the
   embeddable version of the Allegro framework, and that your executable
   has been linked to it, either via Project Builder or XCode, either
   via the allegro-config script.
   If one of these conditions is not met, the created app may not
   work on target machines.

   Bundles created by fixbundle have this default layout:
<textblock>
      bundle.app --- Contents --+--- MacOS --- executable
                                |
                                +--- Resources --+--- (bundle.icns)
                                |                |
                                |                +--- (executable/...)
                                |
                                |
                                +--- (Frameworks) --- (Allegro.framework/...)
                                |
                                +--- Info.plist
                                |
                                +--- PkgInfo
<endblock>
   If you are using Project Builder to compile your programs, there is no
   need to use fixbundle, as the IDE will do the work of generating an
   application bundle for you.

   When an Allegro program starts, it automatically detects if the
   executable lives inside a bundle or not. The working directory is
   always set up to be the directory where the standalone executable
   or application bundle is located, but there is an exception: if the
   application is a bundle and Allegro finds a directory under the bundle
   Contents/Resources path with the same name of the executable (note that
   here we mean the real executable name, not the bundle name), that
   directory is set to be the working one. This allows to easily package
   all the application data inside the bundle, and still have a working
   program without the need to tell your code about the changed location
   of your files.

Notes on drivers

   This section contains MacOS X-specific notes on the drivers available.
<blockquote><dl>
   <dt><b>System:</b></dt><dd>
        When the system driver is about to be initialized, we already
        have a working NSApplication object connected to the Window Server.
        At driver startup, the working directory is changed if inside a
        bundle with a proper data directory under the Contents/Resources
        path (see above).
        
        Display switching is possible, but only the </tt>SWITCH_BACKGROUND</tt>
        mode is supported, so your application will have to deal with it.</dd>

   <dt><b>Graphics:</b></dt><dd>
        The MacOS X windowed graphics mode uses a Cocoa window with a
        Quartz QuickDraw view as its content view. All combinations of
        window/desktop color depths are supported; if needed, color
        conversion will automatically be done transparently to the user.

        Fullscreen mode uses the CoreGraphics DirectDisplay API; only
        8, 15 and 32 bit color depths are supported.</dd>

   <dt><b>Sound:</b></dt><dd>
        The CoreAudio digital/MIDI drivers use V2 AudioUnits, and thus
        they require MacOS X 10.2.x (Jaguar) or newer to work. If this is
        not the case, you can fall back to the Carbon Sound Manager and
        Quicktime MIDI drivers.</dd>

   <dt><b>Keyboard:</b></dt><dd>
        MacOS X Allegro uses the current system keyboard mapping table
        to map scancodes to characters: the keyboard user settings in
        allegro.cfg have no effect.</dd>

   <dt><b>Mouse:</b></dt><dd>
        On MacOS X 10.2.x (Jaguar) or newer, Allegro will automatically
        detect the number of buttons of your mouse at driver initialization.
        If the 1-button Apple mouse is found, the library will activate an
        emulation mode that mimics the way MacOS X itself deals with
        1-button mice: depending on which key is pressed when the button is
        clicked, Allegro will report a different mouse button click.
        (Control + button) emulates a right click and (Option + button)
        emulates a middle click.

        On MacOS X 10.1.x, mouse autodetection is not possible, and Allegro
        will assume an 1-button mouse to always be present, activating
        buttons emulation accordingly.</dd>
</dl></blockquote>


@heading
Notes on Threading and Cocoa GUIs

   It is possible to include a Cocoa GUI in an Allegro application.  If you
   do this you should be aware that Allegro will run your application's
   <code>main()</code> function in a different thread from the thread that
   the main OS X event loop runs in.  See
   <link>http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/Introduction/Introduction.html</a>
   for more information about threading on Mac OS X.


@heading
Final notes

   There is a known compatibility problem when using gcc 4 on MacOS X 10.4
   that prevents binaries from working on older versions of MacOS X. While it
   is anticipated that a future update from Apple will fix this problem, you
   can use gcc 3 to work around it.

   As a final note, when coding Allegro programs don't forget that you
   need to use the <code>END_OF_MAIN()</code> macro right after your <code>main()</code> function!
