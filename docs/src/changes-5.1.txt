Changes from 5.1.1 to 5.1.2 (May 2012)
======================================

Elias Pschernig, Peter Wang.

-  Add userdata to Windows window callbacks and rename the functions
   (Matthew Leverton).

   same translation unit.  Reported by tobing.

-  Make al_ustr_empty_string const correct.

-  Fix many memory leak/warnings on MacOS X (Pär Arvidsson).

Filesystem:

   as directory names even without a trailing slash on Unix.

   correctly.  Reported by Max Savenkov.

Displays:

-  Fixed bug on Windows where two SWITCH_IN events were fired when window was
   minimized/restored (Michael Swiger).

-  Fixed inverted al_toggle_display_flag(ALLEGRO_NOFRAME) logic under Windows
   as well as a bug where repeatedly setting the flag to on would make the
   window grow bigger and bigger (Michael Swiger).

-  Fixed inverted al_toggle_display_flag(ALLEGRO_NOFRAME) logic in X11.

-  Rename al_toggle_display_flag to al_set_display_flag, retaining
   the older name for compatibility.

-  Add ALLEGRO_FRAMELESS as a preferred synonym for the confusing
   ALLEGRO_NOFRAME flag.

-  Set WM_NAME for some window managers (X11).

-  Disable the idle timer on iOS (screen lock) when entering airplay mode.

   textures unless directed otherwise by the user with
   ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE.

-  Added al_clear_depth_buffer and al_set_render_state functions.

-  Force al_create_bitmap to not create oversized bitmaps, to mitigate
   integer overflow problems.

-  Removed initial black frame on all Allegro programs.

OpenGL:

-  Fix null pointer dereference if backbuffer creation fails.
   Reported by Max Savenkov.

-  Made the ALLEGRO_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE flag work with al_draw_bitmap.

   used as row length.

   program object is bound.

-  Do not preserve bound texture state.

-  Disable GL_NORMAL_ARRAY in non-programmable pipeline mode.

-  Arrange code so that sleep and hibernate work using the release and restore
   callbacks.

-  Fix device reset problem in D3D.

   mapped to axes, the number of sticks on a single device may be much higher
   than expected.

-  Monitor /dev/input instead of /dev on Linux for hotplugging joysticks
   (Jon Rafkind).

-  Do not permanently change the locale for the X11 keyboard driver.
   Set LC_CTYPE only, not LC_ALL.

   attached to an event queue (Android and iOS).

-  Don't report shakes at program start accidentally (iOS).

   emulation.

-  Add al_android_get_os_version().

-  Fix linking problem on Android 2.2 and below.

   V2-V5 headers and certain alpha bit masks.

-  Improve robustness of BMP loader against some corrupt files.

-  Fix TGA loader using more memory than necessary.  Reported by Max Savenkov.

-  Image loading in Android now works.
