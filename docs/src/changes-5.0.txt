   (Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock).

Timers:

-  Fix race conditions when starting timers from different threads.

Audio addons:

-  Don't mix into a global temporary sample buffer, causing noise when two
   separate mixers are trying to run in parallel.

    - Use Windows' folder selector for ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FOLDER.

    - Implement patterns.

    - Display the title of the dialog that the user specified.

Primitives addon:

-  Fix changing the D3D blender state without updating the cached state.

TTF addon:

-  Align glyphs in ttf font sheets so as to work around problems with forced
   S3TC compression with some OpenGL drivers (Elias Pschernig).

Examples:

-  SPEED: add full screen flag, use standard paths for highscores and data.

Build system:

-  Check PulseAudio backend will compile before enabling support.

-  Give a louder warning if FLAC/Vorbis/DUMB compile tests fail.

Other:

-  Minor bug fixes and documentation updates.



Changes from 5.0.0 RC3 to 5.0.0 RC4 (December 2010)
===================================================

The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Matthew Leverton,
Elias Pschernig, Peter Wang.

Graphics:

-  d3d: Don't generate intermediate resize events during modal resize loop.

-  Optimize D3D9 driver by caching blender state and scissor rectangle so
   redundant calls to D3D9 functions are avoided (Michał Cichoń).

-  gl: Use glGenerateMipmapEXT to generate mipmaps when FBOs are used.

-  x11: Don't restore display mode if another fullscreen display is active.

Input:

-  iphone: Reverse button/axis events that were swapped at some point.

File I/O:

-  Change the way user code implements new ALLEGRO_FILE structures.
   This adds al_create_file_handle and al_get_file_userdata.

-  Implement default ungetc behavior - used if the interface does not supply
   its own.

-  Add al_fopen_interface.

Memfile addon:

-  Implement ungetc.

-  Add rw file modes.

-  Rename header to allegro_memfile.h.

-  Add documentation.

Image I/O addon:

-  Fix endian issues in TGA and Mac OS X image loaders.

Input:

-  Separate character inputs from physical key down events.  This removes
   unichar and modifiers fields from ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN, and replaces
   ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_REPEAT by ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_CHAR.  We decided this design
   flaw was better fixed now than later.

-  Make Mac OS X keyboard driver properly distinguish key down and key repeat
   events.

iPhone:

-  Added two iPhone-specific functions: al_iphone_override_screen_scale and
   al_iphone_program_has_halted.

Changes from 4.9.22 to 5.0.0 RC1 (November 2010)
================================================

The developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Evert Glebbeek, Elias Pschernig,
Paul Suntsov, Peter Wang.

Graphics:

-  Make al_resize_display keep the original resolution (or change back) if it
   can't set the users request, on Windows.

-  Do not emit ALLEGRO_DISPLAY_RESIZE events from the Windows and X11 display
   drivers when using al_resize_display.

-  [X11] Make al_get_num_display_modes and al_get_display_mode work if the
   adapter is set to default. Right now there was no way to query the modes of
   the default monitor.

-  [X11] Use _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN hint for "true" fullscreen displays.
   Enable mouse grabbing in fullscreen modes.

-  Added ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_ORIENTATION and implement it on iOS.

   renderer, from floats to doubles.

-  Remove al_get_frontbuffer(). It wasn't implemented anywhere.

-  Implement min/mag filter and mipmap flags for Direct3D.

-  Report correct initial mouse position if a display is created with the mouse
   pointer inside, or if the mouse routines are installed after a display is
   created (X11, Windows).

-  John Murphy fixed improperly mapped axes on the Windows joystick driver.

Events:

-  Do not register user event sources with the destructor system as it cannot
   work reliably.  User event sources must be destroyed manually.

Filesystem:

-  Make al_get_fs_entry_name and al_get_current_directory return strings
   instead of ALLEGRO_PATH.

-  Make al_make_directory create parent directories as needed.

-  Fix al_create_fs_entry to not trim the root path "/" down to the empty
   string with the stdio backend.

Path routines:

-  Remove al_make_path_absolute and replace it by al_rebase_path.

-  Remove undocumented behavior of setting a default organization name of
   "allegro" for all apps.

-  Correctly return standard paths as directories on OS X.

Config routines:

-  Add a blank line between sections when writing out a config file.

Other core:

-  Move the Windows event loops back into the same thread as the D3D event
   loop. It's a requirement of D3D, else you can get crashes as I was when
   resetting the device (like tabbing away from a fullscreen app).

-  Add some missing standard entries to the OS X menu bar (the "hide", "hide
   others" and the window list, mainly).

Audio addon:

-  Automatically stop sample instances which point to a buffer of a sample
   which is about to be destroyed with al_destroy_sample.

-  Made thick outlined triangles look nicer when the triangles are very thin.

-  Add a debug-only check for primitives addon initialization to aid in code
   portability.

Examples:

-  Added example demonstrating the effect of premultiplied alpha.

-  Make 'F' toggle fullscreen window in SPEED (in-game).

-  Minor improvements to the a5teroids demo.

-  Many documentation updates.

-  Add list of contributors and a readme for packagers.

-  Make make_doc tool build cleanly on MSVC, and work around a problem with
   recent version of Pandoc on Windows.

-  Improve styling of PDF output.

-  Add generated man pages to archives.

Bindings:

-  Implemented array types in the Python wrapper.

   software triangle renderer, formerly in the primitives addon.

-  Add pixel_size field to ALLEGRO_LOCKED_REGION.

-  Fix bugs to do with pixel alignment on OpenGL.

-  Fix OpenGL pixel transfer of 15 bpp formats, where Allegro does not Allegro
   does not care whether the unused bit is set or not, but when transferring to
   OpenGL it will be interpreted as an alpha bit.

-  Disabled support for drawing a bitmap into itself.

-  Added al_add_new_bitmap_flag convenience function.

-  Added three new bitmaps flags ALLEGRO_MAG_LINEAR, ALLEGRO_MIN_LINEAR,
   ALLEGRO_MIPMAP.  Removed the config settings for linear/anisotropic min/mag
   filtering.  DirectX side not yet updated.

-  Register destructors for bitmaps, so they will be implicitly destroyed when
   Allegro is shut down.  This was only true for some bitmaps previously.

-  Don't allocate memory buffers for video bitmaps when using OpenGL.

-  Make al_get_opengl_extension_list() return NULL if called on a non-GL display.

   The older driver still exists for OS X 10.4 and earlier but is in a
   semi-updated state with regards to hotplugging.

-  Allow user to override joystick device paths in the config file (Linux).

-  Fix iphone touch input and clipping for modes other than w=768,h=1024.

-  Fixed missing mouse movement messages on IPhone on touch-up/down. Also
   changed how mouse buttons are reported - always as button 1 now.

-  Fix jpeg saving when locked region has negative pitch.

Native dialogs addon:

-  Add Windows and OS X text log implementations.

Changes from 4.9.20 to 4.9.21 (July 2010)
=========================================

The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Matthew Leverton,
Elias Pschernig, Paul Suntsov, Peter Wang.

Graphics:

-  Fixed the mis-termed "blend color". There is no more color state.

    - al_set*_blender functions lose the color parameter.

    - Added 5 new bitmap drawing functions al_draw_tinted*_bitmap with a color
      parameter. The parameter is used just like the "blend color" before.

    - All text drawing functions gain a color parameter and use it like they
      used the "blend color" before.

    - Primitive drawing functions previously sometimes (and sometimes not) used
      the "blend color". Not any longer.

-  Make the current blending mode thread-local state instead of per-display
   state.

-  Add explicit display arguments to functions which require a display,
   but don't require the rendering context to be current.

-  Make al_set_target_bitmap change the current display as necessary.
   al_set_target_bitmap(NULL) releases the rendering context.

-  Add al_set_target_backbuffer as a convenience.

-  Remove al_set_current_display.

-  Give each bitmap its own transformation, i.e. every bitmap has a
   transformation, which is in effect when that bitmap is the target.

-  Remove sub-bitmap clip-to-parent restriction on create. Add out-of-bounds
   blitting support to memory bitmaps.

-  Merge sub-bitmap and parent bitmap clipping; clip source bitmap to
   (0,0)-(w,h); fix flipping to/from clipped bitmaps.

-  Made mouse cursors independent of displays.  You may create cursors without
   a display, and you may use a cursor with any display.

-  Rename al_{set,get}_current_video_adapter to *new_display_adapter for
   consistency.

-  Move the new display video adapter and new window position to thread-local
   state, like other new display parameters.  Make al_store_state also save
   those parameters with ALLEGRO_STATE_NEW_DISPLAY_PARAMETERS.

-  Rename al_transform_transform to al_compose_transform.  Switched the order
   of parameters in al_compose_transform and al_copy_transform to match the
   rest of the transform functions.

-  Made memory bitmap manipulation without a display possible (again?).

-  Fixed window resizing in D3D driver.  Simplify resize-postponing on Windows.

-  Make al_create_display abort early when the new_display_adapter is
   greater than the screen count (X11).

-  Added ALLEGRO_MINIMIZED flag to the X11 port.

-  Fixed OpenGL version string parsing (bug #3016654).

Other core:

-  Renamed al_install_timer to al_create_timer, and al_uninstall_timer to
   al_destroy_timer.

-  Rename al\_{get,set}\_{appname,orgname} to \*app_name and \*org_name.

-  Fix assertion failure in al_create_mutex_recursive on Windows (spoofle).

Primitives addon:

-  Made the D3D driver of the primitives addon work with multiple displays.
   Also made it handle the display being destroyed properly.

-  Simplified shader recreating on thread destruction when using the primitives
   addon with D3D.

-  Avoid double free when shutting down the primitives addon multiple times.

-  Older Intel cards don't implement DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP correctly.
   Altered the D3D code to work around that.

Audio addon:

-  Allow setting the DirectSound buffer size via allegro5.cfg.

Image addon:

-  Make GDI+ image loader work with MinGW.

Font addon:

-  Nicolas Martyanoff added al_get_font_descent/ascent functions which query
   per-font properties.  Previously it was necessary to call
   al_get_text_dimensions (which now just reports the text dimensions as it
   should).

Native dialogs addon:

-  Add text log window functions (GTK only for now).

Documentation:

-  Many updates to the reference manual.

-  Improve styling and add Allegro version to HTML pages.

-  Separated readme_a5.txt into multiple files, and hopefully improve them.

Build system:

-  Remove INSTALL_PREFIX.  Windows users can now use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
   set the install path.

-  Allow the user to place dependencies in a subdirectory "deps", which will
   be automatically searched.

Examples:

-  Use text log windows in many examples.

-  Add ex_noframe: test bitmap manipulation without a display.

Bindings:

- Update Python bindings.



Changes from 4.9.19 to 4.9.20 (May 2010)
========================================

The developers this time were: Thomas Fjellstrom, Evert Glebbeek,
Matthew Leverton, Milan Mimica, Paul Suntsov, Trent Gamblin, Elias Pschernig,
Peter Wang.  With significant contributions from Michał Cichoń.

Core:

-  Add al_malloc, al_free, et al.  These are now used consistently throughout
   Allegro and its addons.

-  Replace al_set_memory_management_functions by a simpler function,
   al_set_memory_interface.

-  Renamed some D3D/Windows specific functions to follow the al_{verb}_{stuff}
   convention.

Graphics:

-  Move image I/O framework to core, i.e. al_load_bitmap, al_save_bitmap and
   bitmap file type registration.  Image codecs remain in allegro_image.

-  Added a simple display capabilities querying capability to
   al_get_display_option: ALLEGRO_MAX_BITMAP_SIZE, ALLEGRO_SUPPORT_NPOT_BITMAP,
   ALLEGRO_CAN_DRAW_INTO_BITMAP, ALLEGRO_SUPPORT_SEPARATE_ALPHA.
   (OpenGL only for now)

-  Fix in OpenGL 3.0 context creation.

-  Make the extensions mechanism compatible with OpenGL version >= 3.
   Declared symbols needed by OpenGL 3.2 and 3.3 and brought OpenGL extensions
   up to date.

-  Fix an assertion in _al_draw_bitmap_region_memory so it does not trigger
   when source and destination are the same bitmap.

-  Fix some locking issues by setting GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT and GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT
   before reading/writing pixels.

-  Partial implementation of ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW on OS X (Snow Leopard,
   probably Leopard).

-  Started X11 fullscreen support (resolution switching).

-  Fix handling of X11 size hints.

-  Fixed a deadlock related to fullscreen windows under X11 caused by using a
   nested lock for a condition variable.

-  Use _NET_WM_ICON to set icon on X11 instead of XSetWMHints.

-  Get the iPhone OpenGL version more properly.  Only use separate blending on
   iPhone with OpenGL ES 2.0+.

-  Release the splash view and windows on iPhone, which makes backgrounding
   Allegro apps on OS 4.0 work.

-  Updated iphone port for IPad (only tested in the simulator).

Input:

-  Disabled Raw Input code in Windows.  Mouse events now reflect system cursor
   movements even in fullscreen mode.

-  Prevent late WM_MOUSELEAVE notifications from overriding mouse state display
   field (Windows).

-  Update pollable mouse state with axes events as well as button events on
   iPhone.

Filesystem:

-  Made the filesystem entry functions work under Windows even if the name
   passed to al_create_fs_entry has a trailing slash or backslash.

Config routines:

-  Add al_{load,save}_config_file_f.

-  Reorder al_save_config_file* arguments to match al_save_bitmap and
   al_save_sample.

-  Optimise config routines to work well for thousands of keys/sections.

Image addon:

-  Added a GDI+ implementation of the image codecs, which will be used in
   favour of libjpeg/libpng if Allegro is compiled with MSVC.  Then
   allegro_image will not require JPEG/PNG DLLs at runtime.

-  Removed format specific image functions.

-  Fixed bug in native png loader on iphone: was using the source color space
   instead of the target color space which made it fail whenever they differed
   (alpha-less paletted pictures).

-  Add an autorelease pool around iphone native image loading to stop memory
   leaks.

Font addons:

-  Sever the tie between allegro_font and allegro_image.
   The user needs to initialise the image addon separately now.

-  Rename al_load_ttf_font_entry to al_load_ttf_font_f.

-  Fixed problem with glyph precision after applying transformations in the ttf
   addon.

Primitives addon:

-  Added al_init_primitives addon function.  This is now required.

-  Removed ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR; ALLEGRO_COLOR can now be used where it was
   required.

-  v textures coordinates were off for OpenGL non-power-of-two textures.

-  Free the vertex cache in al_destroy_display on X11.

-  Added the dummy vertex shader support to D3D driver of the primitives addon.
   Without this, custom vertices either resulted in warnings or outright
   crashes on some systems.

-  Bring D3D driver up to speed a little bit: transformations now work properly
   with sub-bitmap targets; the half-pixel offset now properly interacts with
   transformations; al_set_target_bitmap does not clear the transformation; the
   proper transformation is set at display creation.

-  Cull the primitives that are completely outside the clipping region.

-  Scale the numbers of vertices for the curvy primitives with the scale of the
   current transformation.

Audio addon:

-  Remove driver parameter from al_install_audio.

-  Rename al_get_depth_size to al_get_audio_depth_size.

-  Rename al_get_audio_stream_buffer to al_get_audio_stream_fragment.

-  Many improvements to AQueue driver.

Audio codecs:

-  Add MOD/S3M/XM/IT file support, using the DUMB library.

-  Revert to a monolithic allegro_acodec addon, i.e. remove separate
   allegro_flac, allegro_vorbis addons.  WAV file support is in allegro_acodec.

-  Implement DLL loading for FLAC/Vorbis/DUMB on Windows.  allegro_acodec will
   load the DLL at runtime to enable support for that format.  If your program
   does not require said format, you don't need to distribute the DLL.

-  Remove format-specific loader/saver audio codec functions.

-  Make acodec loaders have consistent file closing behaviour.

-  Optimised wave file loading.

Examples:

-  Make SPEED port run acceptably on graphics drivers without FBOs.

Documentation:

-  Added documentation for the public Direct3D specific functions.

-  Documented ALLEGRO_OPENGL_3_0 and ALLEGRO_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE.

Other:

-  Many bug and documentation fixes.



Changes from 4.9.18 to 4.9.19 (April 2010)
==========================================

The main developers this time were: Milan Mimica, Trent Gamblin, Paul Suntsov,
Peter Wang.  Other contributions from: Evert Glebbeek and Shawn Hargreaves.

Graphics:

-  Implemented support for transformations for memory bitmaps.

-  Transformations now work properly when the target bitmap is a sub-bitmap in
   OpenGL (still broken in D3D). Also fixed OpenGL bitmap drawing in the same
   scenario (it used to always revert to software drawing).

-  Use the memory drawers when the source bitmap is the backbuffer with the
   rotated/scaled bitmaps.

-  Make al_put_pixel clip even if the bitmap is locked, which was the reason
   why software primitives were not clipping.

-  Added al_put_blended_pixel, the blended version of al_put_pixel.

-  Sub bitmaps of sub bitmaps must be clipped to the first parent.

-  Don't clear the transformation when setting the target bitmap in OpenGL.

-  Implemented ALLEGRO_NOFRAME and ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW in WGL.

-  Set the ALLEGRO_DISPLAY->refresh_rate variable for fullscreen modes under D3D.

-  Make d3d_clear return immediately if the display is in a lost state.

-  Rewrote the function that reads the OpenGL version so it works for
   previously unrecognised versions, and future versions.

-  Check for framebuffer extension on iPhone properly.

-  Fixed locking bugs on iPhone. allegro_ttf works now.

Input:

-  Removed al_set_mouse_range.

-  Don't call al_get_mouse_state if the mouse driver isn't installed (Windows).

-  Send events even when the mouse cursor leaves the window, while any buttons
   are held down (Windows and Mac OS X; X11 already did this).

Changes from 4.9.17 to 4.9.18 (March 2010)
==========================================

The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Elias Pschernig, Evert
Glebbeek, Peter Wang.  Other contributions from: Milan Mimica, Paul Suntsov,
Peter Hull.

Graphics:

-  Fixed broken drawing into memory bitmaps as access to the global
   transformation required an active display. Now both transformation and
   current blending mode are stored in the display but provisions are made for
   them to also work if the current thread has no display.

-  Fixed a bunch of clipping problems with OpenGL, especially with sub-bitmaps.

-  Fix bug in OpenGL FBO setup when the target bitmap is the sub-bitmap of a
   bitmap with an FBO.

-  Fixed crash in al_get_num_display_modes under OSX 10.5.

-  Fixed some problems in _al_convert_to_display_bitmap that caused problems in
   WGL FS display resize.

-  Fixed al_set_current_display(NULL) on WGL.

-  Added subtractive blending.  al_set_blender() takes another parameter.

-  Added ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW display flag (X11 and D3D for now).

-  Allow changing ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW with al_toggle_display_flag.

-  Figured out how to switch display modes using Carbon on OS X 10.6.

-  Stop the OpenGL driver on iPhone from changing the currently bound FBO
   behind our back when locking a bitmap.

-  Prevent screen flicker at app startup by simulating the splash screen
   (iPhone).

Input:

-  Added "pressure" field to the mouse event struct and mouse state, which can
   be used with pressure sensitive pointing devices, i.e. tablets/stylus
   (currently OS X only).

-  Report scroll ball "w" position in mouse event struct, on OS X.

-  Removed OS X 10.1 specific code from mouse driver. We don't support OS X
   10.1 any more.

-  Fix building of Linux joystick driver on some systems.

Threads:

-  Fix a problem when al_join_thread() is called immediately after
   al_start_thread().  The thread could be joined before the user's thread
   function starts at all.

-  Fix a possible deadlock with al_join_thread() on Windows (thanks to Michał
   Cichoń for the report).

-  Fix some error messages running threading examples on OS X.

Other core:

-  Added version check to al_install_system.

-  Rename al_free_path to al_destroy_path for consistency.

-  Make it possible to have an empty organization name with al_set_org_name().

-  Changed implementation of AL_ASSERT to use POSIX-standard assert instead.

-  Removed al_register_assert_handler.

-  Fix timer macros which did not parenthesize their arguments.

-  Make stricmp, strlwr, strupr macros conditionally defined.

Audio addon:

-  Rename al_attach_sample_to_mixer to al_attach_sample_instance_to_mixer.

-  Fix a premature free() when detaching samples and other audio objects.

-  Fix mixers attaching to mixers.

-  Pass correct number of samples to mixer postprocess callback.

-  AudioQueue code was not compiled even though version requirements may have
   been met (OS X).

Primitives addon:

-  Make high-level primitives functions thread safe. (note: the DirectX driver
   is not yet thread safe)

-  Fix a bug causing crashes on Windows 7 when using the primitives addon and
   Direct3D (Invalid vertex declarations were being used).

-  Fixed another issue with primitives drawing to memory bitmaps.

-  Hopefully fix the bitmap clipping bugs, and make the D3D and OGL/Software
   outputs to be near-identical again.

Image addon:

-  Added a "native loader" for MacOS X that uses the NSImage bitmap loading
   functions. In addition to .png and .jpg, this allows us to read a whole zoo
   of image formats (listed in allegro.log).

-  Add native support for tif, jpg, gif, png, BMPf, ico, cur, xbm formats to
   under IPhone.

-  Fixed an over-zealous ASSERT() that disallowed passing NULL to
   al_register_bitmap_loader() despite this being an allowed value.

-  Avoid using a field which is deprecated in libpng 1.4.

Color addon:

-  Make al_color_name_to_rgb return a bool.

Native dialogs addon:

-  Fixed some erratic behaviour and crashes on OS X.

Build system:

-  Set VERSION and SOVERSION properties on targets to give Unix shared
   libraries proper sonames.
   e.g. liballegro[_addon].so.4.9, liballegro[_addon].4.9.dylib

-  Static libraries are now named without version number suffixes
   to minimise the differences with the shared libraries, which no longer
   have the versions in their base names.
   e.g. liballegro[_addon]-static.a, allegro[_addon]-static.lib

-  Windows import libraries are also named without version suffixes, e.g.
   liballegro[_addon].a, allegro[_addon].lib

-  DLLs are named with a short version suffix, not the full version.
   e.g. allegro-4.9.dll instead of allegro-4.9.18.dll

-  Add support for Mac OS X frameworks (untested), which are enabled with
   WANT_FRAMEWORKS and WANT_EMBED.  There is one framework per addon.

-  Search for static OGG/Vorbis libraries built with MSVC named
   libogg_static.lib, etc.

-  Updated iPhone XCode project.

Examples:

-  ex_mixer_pp: New example to test mixer postprocessing callbacks.

-  ex_threads: Make it more visually interesting and test out per-display
   transformations.

-  ex_ogre3d: New example demonstrating use of Ogre graphics rendering
   alongside Allegro (currently GLX only).  Commented out in the build system
   for now.

-  ex_fs_window: New example to test ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW flag and
   al_toggle_display_flag.

-  ex_blend2: Updated to test subtractive blending, including scaled/rotated
   blits and the primitives addon.

   reference manual.

-  Minor improvements to HTML styling and man page output.



Changes from 4.9.16 to 4.9.17 (February 2010)
=============================================

The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Elias Pschernig, Evert
Glebbeek, Paul Suntsov, Peter Wang.

Core:

-   Removed END_OF_MAIN() everywhere.

    For MSVC, we pass a linker option through a #pragma.

    On Mac OS X, we rename main() and call it from a real main() function in
    the allegro-main addon.  The prototype for main() for C++ applications
    should be "int main(int, char **)", or the code will not compile on OS X.
    For C, either of the normal ANSI forms is fine.

    \#define ALLEGRO_NO_MAGIC_MAIN disables the \#pragma or name mangling, so
    you can write a WinMain() or use al_run_main() yourself.

Graphics:

-  Fixed a bug in the OpenGL driver where al_draw_bitmap() wouldn't handle
   blitting from the back buffer.

-  Changing the blending color now works with deferred drawing (Todd Cope).

-  Avoid some problems with window resizing in Windows/D3D.

-  Added al_get_d3d_texture_position.

-  Fixed bug under X11 where al_create_display() would always use the display
   options from the first al_create_display() call.

-  Properly implemented osx_get_opengl_pixelformat_attributes().

-  Fixed automatic detection of colour depth on OS X.

-  Fixed al_get_num_display_modes() on Mac OS X 10.6.

-  Removed al_get_num_display_formats, al_get_display_format_option,
   al_set_new_display_format functions as they can't be implemented on
   OSX/iPhone/GPX ports (and were awkward to use).

-  Replaced al_toggle_window_frame function with a new function
   al_toggle_display_flags.

-  al_load_bitmap() and al_convert_mask_to_alpha() no longer reset the current
   transformation.

-  Add a minimize button to all non-resizable windows on Windows.

-  The wgl display switch-in/out vtable entries were swapped (Milan Mimica).

Input:

-  Some keycodes were out of order in src/win/wkeyboard.c

-  Fixed mouse range after resizing window on Windows.

-  Fixed (or worked around) a joystick axis detection problem on Mac OS X.

-  Change timer counts from 'long' to 'int64_t'.

File I/O:

-  Remove `ret_success' arguments from al_fread32be/le.

allegro-main addon:

-  Added an "allegro-main" addon to hold the main() function that is required
   on Mac OS X.  This way the user can opt out of it.

Primitives addon:

-  Added support for sub-bitmap textures in OpenGL driver.

-  Added support for sub-bitmap textures in D3D driver.
   Made D3D sub-bitmaps work better with user D3D code.

Audio addons:

-  Changed the _stream suffix to _f in the audio loading functions.

-  Added the stream versions of loading functions for wav, ogg and flac.

-  Rename audio I/O functions to al_load_{format}, al_save_{format},
   al_load_{format}_f and al_save_{format}_f.

-  Added al_load_sample_f, al_save_sample_f, al_load_audio_stream_f and the
   related functions.

-  Fixed a bug where al_save_sample was improperly handling the extension.

-  al_drain_audio_stream would hang on an audio stream in the 'playing' state
   (the default) which wasn't attached to anything.

-  Fixed a potential deadlock on destroying audio streams by shutting down the
   audio driver.

-  Comment out PA_SINK_SUSPENDED check, which breaks the PulseAudio driver, at
   least on Ubuntu 9.10.

-  Replace unnecessary uses of `long' in audio interfaces.

Image addons:

-  Fixed return values of al_save_bmp_f and al_save_pcx_f being ignored.

-  Changed the _stream suffix to _f in the image loading functions.

TTF addon:

-  Drawing TTF fonts no longer resets the current transformation.

Build system:

-  Add the CMake option FLAC_STATIC, required when using MSVC with a static
   FLAC library.

-  Link with zlib if linking with PhysicsFS is not enough.

-  Updated iPhone project files.

Documentation:

-  Many documentation updates.

Examples:

-  ex_display_options: Added mouse support, query current display settings,
   display error if a mode can't be set.

Bindings:

-  Made the Python wrapper work under OSX.

-  Added a CMake option to build the Python wrapper.

-  Added al_run_main() mainly to support the Python wrapper on OSX.

-  Enable sub-pixel accuracy for rotated blitting in software.

-  Made the D3D output look closer to the OGL/Software output.

-  OpenGL driver now respects the 'linear' texture filtering configuration
   option.  Anisotropic is interpreted as linear at this time.

-  Added deferred bitmap drawing (al_hold_bitmap_drawing).

-  Made the font addons use deferred bitmap drawing instead of the primitives
   addon, removing the link between the two addons.

-  Changed al_transform_vertex to al_transform_coordinates to make the
   function more versatile.

-  Transfered transformations from the primitives addon into the core.
   Added documentation for that, as well as a new example, ex_transform.
   Transformations work for hardware accelerated bitmap drawing (including
   fonts) but the software component is not implemented as of yet.
   Also fixed some bugs inside the code of the transformations.

-  Increase performance of screen->bitmap blitting in the D3D driver.

-  Fixed a strange bug with textured primitives (u/v repeat flags were being
   ignored on occasion).

-  Added ALLEGRO_VIDEO_BITMAP for consistency.

Input:

-  Work around a memory leak in iPhone OS that occurs when the accelerometer
   is on during touch input.

Other core:

-  Don't #define true/false/bool macros in C++.

   primitives a little faster; added workabouts for people with old/Intel
   graphics cards.

-  Fall back to software if given a memory bitmap as a texture.

-  Removed OpenGL state saving code, it was causing massive slowdown when
   drawing.  Also removed glFlush for the same reason.

Audio addon:

-  Added PulseAudio driver.

-  Support AudioQueue driver on Mac OS X.

-  Add al_uninstall_audio exit function.

-  Added ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FINISHED event to signify when non-looping
   streams made with al_load_audio_stream reach the end of the file.

   event masking was probably not very useful anyway. In all, the
   functions removed are: al_event_source_mask, al_event_source_set_mask,
   al_wait_for_specific_event. The al_wait_for_specific_event() API also
   required event types to be bitfields.

   area with the gui_bg_color.

   generation system. The documentation is nowhere near as good as a proper
   manual, but it's still better than nothing.

-  Added CMake and SCons build systems. These are mainly for use by Allegro
   developers at present.

-  Various bug fixes and minor changes.



Changes from 4.2 series to 4.9.0 (July 2006)
============================================

*Note that 4.9.0 was called 4.3.0 when it was originally released.*

Basically we're just wrapping up what we have in version control up to
now.  See the commit logs if you want details.

This release introduces a few new subsystems.  We have an event system, a
new keyboard API, a new joystick API, a new timer API, and the start of a
new graphics API.  All of these are subject to change, as is usual for
a WIP.

We are maintaining a certain level of source compatibility with the 4.2
API.  If it's easy to maintain compatibility then we do it, otherwise
compatibility is dropped.  Obscure features are more likely to be dropped.

This release has had minimal testing on Linux/x86, Windows/x86 (MinGW) and
Windows/x86 (MSVC).  It seems to work on some Linux/x86-64 machines also.
Other ports are broken or untested.

The new functions are as follows (in no particular order).  No real
documentation exists at the moment but interesting header files
are: altime.h, display.h, draw.h, events.h, joystick.h, keyboard.h,
timer.h.
