    control when bitmap context backup is performed.

Android port:

  - Add .gitignore and ignore build/ dir (Mark Oates).

  - Fix building examples with non-Allegro dependencies with the monolith build.

Acodec addon:

  - Allow file-backed audio streams to be restarted after they finish.

  - Add Opus codec support.

Image addon:

  - Fail gracefully if not built with PNG/JPG loaders.

Font addon:

  - Make `al_get_text_dimensions` and `al_get_glyph_dimensions` return exact
    bounding boxes (koro).

Changes from 5.1.13.1 to 5.2.0 (April 2016)
============================================

The main developers this time were: SiegeLord, Polybios, Mark Oates,
Elias Pschernig and Jonathan Seeley.

Core:

  - Add `al_is_event_source_registered` (koro).

  - Make destructors log messages more meaningful.

  - Mouse emulation API for touch devices is now unstable.

  - Rename `al_convert_bitmaps` to `al_convert_memory_bitmaps`.

Input:

  - Haptic API is now unstable.

Android port:

  - Fixed bogus display destruction on Android which previously caused
    zombie states.

OSX port:

  - Fix OSX mouse state position scaling.

  - Fix other various scaling issues.

  - Make toggling A5O_FRAMELESS work.

  - Fix an issue where fullscreen windows would occasionally leave empty space
    for the titlebar.

  - Fix incorrect debug assert in the audio addon.

Windows port:

  - Make Allegro apps DPI-aware by default, which means that they won't be
    scaled by the OS.

  - Fix compilation for the CPU detection code on some compilers.

  - Don't sync the D3D bitmap when locking with WRITE_ONLY.

  - Remove dsound.dll runtime loading.

  - Don't link xinput and d3dx9 libraries (they are still required at runtime
    though if you're using the relevant features).

  - Fix a bug where al_wait_for_event_timed can block despite 0 timeout
    (Aldo Nunez).

Build system:

  - Install PDB files when building with MSVC.

Documentation:

  - Fix source links for API entries with multi-line prototypes.

  - Make the readme look prettier on GitHub.

  - Tons of assorted documentation improvements, especially for the audio addon.

Other:

  - Add a stability system where some unstable APIs need to be opted into by
    defining `A5O_UNSTABLE` before including Allegro headers.

Audio addon:

  - Fix sporadic deadlocks

  - Recorder API is now unstable.

Native dialog addon:

  - `al_toggle_menu_item_flags` is now unstable.

TTF addon:

  - Add an option to pre-cache the glyphs, useful for platforms where the
    current algorithm is buggy (typically some Android devices).

Video addon:

  - Temporarily remove FFmpeg backend, as it was too buggy, didn't build and was
    too hard to fix.

Examples:

  - Make `ex_vsync` less likely cause a seizure.

  - Make `ex_draw_bitmap` and `ex_touch_input` switch in/out on Android.

  - Add documentation to `ex_bitmap` (Daniel Johnson).

  - Improve `ex_logo` text entry experience.
