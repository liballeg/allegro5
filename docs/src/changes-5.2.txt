% Allegro changelog for 5.2.x series

These lists serve as summaries; the full histories are in the git repository.


Changes from 5.2.1.1 to 5.2.2 (December 2016)
=======================================

The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, SiegeLord, Elias Pschernig.

Core:

  - Don't accumulate time in the timer while it is stopped.

  - Use dynamic OpenGL ES checks, so binaries produced on newer platforms
    don't crash on older ones.

  - Destabilize the OpenGL extensions API (BREAKING CHANGE!).

Raspberry Pi port:

  - Add various optimizations.

  - Fix `al_set_mouse_xy` under X.

Android port:

  - Fix buffer overrun and memory leak in the clipboard support.

  - Add WANT_GLES3 to disable some of the newer features on platforms where they
    aren't supported.

  - Fix build in Android versions below 3.1.

  - Fix a crash when activity is destroyed/paused.

  - Allow building for android mips, arm64 and mips64.

  - Add `al_android_get_jni_env` and `al_android_get_activity` utility
    functions.

  - Update manifest files for newer Android versions.

Windows port:

  - Handle keyboard input properly when Ctrl is pressed (Tobias Scheuer).

Hurd port:

  - Define a fallback PATH_MAX (Andreas Rönnquist).

OSX port:

  - Clear window to black when going in/out of fullscreen.

  - Fix window centering when going out of FULLSCREEN_WINDOW mode.

  - Fix OSX 10.12 build.

  - Allow 32 bit builds on OSX (MarcusCalhoun-Lopez).

Build system:

  - Fix issues with building on GCC6 on Windows.

  - Fix source directory littering while configuring the Android build.

Python binding:

  - Add support Python 3 (Gabriel Queiroz).

Documentation:

  - Document the behavior of `al_set_target_bitmap` with respect to
    transformations (Edgar Reynaldo).

  - Fix typo in `al_use_transform` docs (Ryan Roden-Corrent).

Examples:

  - Add kerning to the `al_get_glyph` example in ex_ttf.

  - Various fixes in ex_camera (Erich Erstu).


Changes from 5.2.1 to 5.2.1.1 (August 2016)
=======================================

The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, SiegeLord.

Core:

  - Enforce backwards compatibility in the version check, rather than
    erroneously allowing forwards compatiblity.

  - Temporarily remove new extensions in ALLEGRO_OGL_EXT_LIST as that broke ABI
    compatibility.

OSX port:

  - Temporarily revert changes in joystick detection, as it did not interact
    well with some joysticks.

Windows port:

  - Fix the clear display to black right away to avoid an ugly white flash
    change.


Changes from 5.2.0 to 5.2.1 (July 2016)
=======================================

The main developers this time were: Elias Pschernig, Trent Gamblin, SiegeLord,
Ryan Roden-Corrent, Boris Carvajal and Peter Hull.

Core:

  - Optimize bitmap holding a bit (Bruce Pascoe).

  - Add `al_get/set_depth/samples` (OpenGL only for now).

  - Optimize destruction performance when you have thousands of objects
    (e.g. sub-bitmaps).

  - Use low floating point precision for the OpenGL fragment shaders, which
    helps performance a lot on mobile platforms.

  - Don't stop and join the timer thread when stopping the last timer (prevents
    unnecessary delay in this situation on some platforms).

  - Add `al_backup_dirty_bitmap` and `al_backup_dirty_bitmaps` to more finely
    control when bitmap context backup is performed.

Android port:

  - Fix Android app issues when woken up during sleep.

  - Specify the Android toolchain file on the command line now.
    ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT now has to be specified in an environment
    variable.

OSX port:

  - Improve joystick enumeration (Todd Cope).

  - Make `al_set_new_window_title` work correctly.

  - Don't send duplicate mouse move events.

  - Fix mouse warping behavior.

  - Exit fullscreen mode if ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW is set when destroying a
    display (otherwise if you destroy and recreate display without terminating
    the program, a white window kicks around).

iOS port:

  - Make it compile again.

  - Don't backup textures as it is unnecessary.

  - Update minimum iOS to version to 6.1.

  - Disable the native png loader in favor of libpng, as it is broken on
    Apple's end.

  - Create library when creating the archive.

Windows port:

  - Fix the D3D target bitmap bug.

  - Clear display to black right away to avoid an ugly white flash.

Raspberry Pi port:

  - Fix system cursor support.

Linux port:

  - Make `al_set_new_window_title` work correctly.

Build system:

  - Use PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR and PROJECT_BINARY_DIR instead of CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
    and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR. This lets you use Allegro as a sub-project in your
    CMake project.

  - Fix GDIPlus finding in cmake-gui (Bruce Pascoe).

  - Add .gitignore and ignore build/ dir (Mark Oates).

  - Fix building examples with non-Allegro dependencies with the monolith build.

Documentation:

  - Various documentation updates (Daniel Johnson and others).

Other:

  - Add more `#include` statements in Allegro headers, so it's easier to use
    them in isolation (Jordan Woehr).

  - Allow marking tests as being hardware only.

  - Prefix some private Allegro macros and types to not pollute the namespace.

  - Make set_shader_uniform api const-correct (Bruce Pascoe).

Audio addon:

  - Adjust loop end position when calling `al_set_sample_instance_length`.

Acodec addon:

  - Allow file-backed audio streams to be restarted after they finish.

  - Add Opus codec support.

Image addon:

  - Fail gracefully if not built with PNG/JPG loaders.

Native dialog addon:

Font addon:

  - Make `al_get_text_dimensions` and `al_get_glyph_dimensions` return exact
    bounding boxes (koro).

  - Add `ALLEGRO_GLYPH` structure and `al_get_glyph`, allowing for some
    additional optimization when drawing fonts.

Examples:

  - Add more controls to `ex_audio_props`.

  - Add an example of using Enet with Allegro.



Changes from 5.1.13.1 to 5.2.0 (April 2016)
============================================

The main developers this time were: SiegeLord, Polybios, Mark Oates,
Elias Pschernig and Jonathan Seeley.

Core:

  - Add `al_is_event_source_registered` (koro).

  - Make destructors log messages more meaningful.

  - Mouse emulation API for touch devices is now unstable.

  - Rename `al_convert_bitmaps` to `al_convert_memory_bitmaps`.

Input:

  - Haptic API is now unstable.

Android port:

  - Fixed bogus display destruction on Android which previously caused
    zombie states.

OSX port:

  - Fix OSX mouse state position scaling.

  - Fix other various scaling issues.

  - Make toggling ALLEGRO_FRAMELESS work.

  - Fix an issue where fullscreen windows would occasionally leave empty space
    for the titlebar.

  - Fix incorrect debug assert in the audio addon.

Windows port:

  - Make Allegro apps DPI-aware by default, which means that they won't be
    scaled by the OS.

  - Fix compilation for the CPU detection code on some compilers.

  - Don't sync the D3D bitmap when locking with WRITE_ONLY.

  - Remove dsound.dll runtime loading.

  - Don't link xinput and d3dx9 libraries (they are still required at runtime
    though if you're using the relevant features).

  - Fix a bug where al_wait_for_event_timed can block despite 0 timeout
    (Aldo Nunez).

Build system:

  - Install PDB files when building with MSVC.

Documentation:

  - Fix source links for API entries with multi-line prototypes.

  - Make the readme look prettier on GitHub.

  - Tons of assorted documentation improvements, especially for the audio addon.

Other:

  - Add a stability system where some unstable APIs need to be opted into by
    defining `ALLEGRO_UNSTABLE` before including Allegro headers.

Audio addon:

  - Fix sporadic deadlocks

  - Recorder API is now unstable.

Native dialog addon:

  - `al_toggle_menu_item_flags` is now unstable.

TTF addon:

  - Add an option to pre-cache the glyphs, useful for platforms where the
    current algorithm is buggy (typically some Android devices).

Video addon:

  - Temporarily remove FFmpeg backend, as it was too buggy, didn't build and was
    too hard to fix.

Examples:

  - Make `ex_vsync` less likely cause a seizure.

  - Make `ex_draw_bitmap` and `ex_touch_input` switch in/out on Android.

  - Add documentation to `ex_bitmap` (Daniel Johnson).

  - Improve `ex_logo` text entry experience.
