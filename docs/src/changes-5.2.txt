    erroneously allowing forwards compatiblity.

  - Temporarily remove new extensions in ALLEGRO_OGL_EXT_LIST as that broke ABI
    compatibility.

OSX port:

Changes from 5.2.0 to 5.2.1 (July 2016)
=======================================

The main developers this time were: Elias Pschernig, Trent Gamblin, SiegeLord,
Ryan Roden-Corrent, Boris Carvajal and Peter Hull.

    unnecessary delay in this situation on some platforms).

  - Add `al_backup_dirty_bitmap` and `al_backup_dirty_bitmaps` to more finely
    control when bitmap context backup is performed.

Android port:

  - Fix Android app issues when woken up during sleep.

iOS port:

  - Make it compile again.

  - Add .gitignore and ignore build/ dir (Mark Oates).

  - Fix building examples with non-Allegro dependencies with the monolith build.

    them in isolation (Jordan Woehr).

  - Allow marking tests as being hardware only.

  - Prefix some private Allegro macros and types to not pollute the namespace.

  - Make set_shader_uniform api const-correct (Bruce Pascoe).

  - Fix sporadic deadlocks

  - Recorder API is now unstable.

Native dialog addon:

  - `al_toggle_menu_item_flags` is now unstable.

TTF addon:

    too hard to fix.

Examples:

  - Make `ex_vsync` less likely cause a seizure.
