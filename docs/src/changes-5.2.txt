========================================

The main developers this time were: SiegeLord, Elias Pschernig,
Sebastian Krzyszkowiak, Julian Smythe.

Build system:

- Allow configuring bitmap wrapping via `al_set_new_bitmap_wrap`.

Graphics:

- Reject creating bitmaps with negative width or height (Peter Hull).

  features, but is faster (Issue #1120). Select it via the `_MINIMAL` suffix to
  the shader platforms.

Emscripten:

- Improve emscripten instructions for building demos (Connor Clark).

- Fix usage of SDL_Init for emscripten (Issue #1322) (Connor Clark).

  (HerrNamenlos123).

- Allow specifying shader model 3_0 for HLSL shaders (Issue #1154).

SDL:
