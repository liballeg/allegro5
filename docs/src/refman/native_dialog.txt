# Native dialogs support

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_dialog.

    #include <allegro5/allegro_native_dialog.h>

## API: ALLEGRO_NATIVE_DIALOG

Opaque handle to a native dialog.

## API: al_create_native_file_dialog

Creates a new native file dialog.  You should only have one such dialog opened
at a time.

Parameters:

- initial_path: The initial search path and filename. Can be NULL.
- title: Title of the dialog.
- patterns: A list of semi-colon separated patterns to match. You
  should always include the pattern "\*.*" as usually the MIME type
  and not the file pattern is relevant. If no file patterns are
  supported by the native dialog, this parameter is ignored.
- mode: 0, or a combination of the flags below.

Possible flags for the 'mode' parameter are:

- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FILE_MUST_EXIST: If supported by the native dialog,
  it will not allow entering new names, but just allow existing files
  to be selected. Else it is ignored.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SAVE: If the native dialog system has a
  different dialog for saving (for example one which allows creating
  new directories), it is used. Else ignored.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FOLDER: If there is support for a separate
  dialog to select a folder instead of a file, it will be used.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_PICTURES: If a different dialog is available
  for selecting pictures, it is used. Else ignored.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SHOW_HIDDEN: If the platform supports it, also
  hidden files will be shown.
- ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_MULTIPLE: If supported, allow selecting
  multiple files.

Returns:

A handle to the dialog which you can pass to
[al_show_native_file_dialog] to display it, and from which you then can
query the results. When you are done, call
[al_destroy_native_file_dialog] on it.

## API: al_show_native_file_dialog

Show the dialog window.  The display may be NULL, otherwise the given display
is treated as the parent if possible.

This function blocks the calling thread until it returns,
so you may want to spawn a thread with [al_create_thread] and
call it from inside that thread.

## API: al_get_native_file_dialog_count

Returns the number of files selected, or 0 if the dialog was cancelled.

## API: al_get_native_file_dialog_path

Returns one of the selected paths.

## API: al_destroy_native_dialog

Frees up all resources used by the dialog.

## API: al_show_native_message_box

Show a native GUI message box. This can be used for example to display an error
message if creation of an initial display fails.  The display may be NULL,
otherwise the given display is treated as the parent if possible.

The message box will have a single "OK" button and use the style informative
dialog boxes usually have on the native system. If the `buttons` parameter is
not NULL, you can instead specify the button text in a string, with buttons
separated by a vertical bar (|).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flags
----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_WARN       The message is a warning.
                                 This may cause a different icon
                                 (or other effects).

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_ERROR      The message is an error.

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_QUESTION   The message is a question.

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_OK_CANCEL  Instead of the "OK" button also display a cancel
                                 button. Ignored if `buttons` is not NULL.

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_YES_NO     Instead of the "OK" button display Yes/No
                                 buttons. Ignored if `buttons` is not NULL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returns:

- 0 if the dialog window was closed without activating a button.
- 1 if the OK or Yes button was pressed.
- 2 if the Cancel or No button was pressed.

If `buttons` is not NULL, the number of the pressed button is returned, starting
with 1.

Example:

      button = al_show_native_message_box("Fullscreen?",
         "Do you want to run this game in fullscreen mode?",
         "Never|Always|Not this time|Only this time",
         ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_QUESTION);
      /* button is 1/2/3/4 if one of the buttons is pressed, 0 if the window
       * is closed.
       */

## API: al_open_native_text_log

Opens a window to which you can append log messages with
[al_append_native_text_log]. This can be useful for debugging if you don't
want to depend on a console being available.

Use [al_close_native_text_log] to close the window again.

The only flag so far is ALLEGRO_MESSAGELOG_NO_CLOSE - it will prevent
the window from having a close button. Otherwise if the close button
is pressed an event is generated; see [al_get_native_dialog_event_source].

Returns NULL if there was an error opening the window, or if text log windows
are not implemented on the platform.

See also: [al_append_native_text_log], [al_close_native_text_log]

## API: al_close_native_text_log

Closes a message log window opened with [al_open_native_text_log]
earlier.

Does nothing if passed NULL.

See also: [al_open_native_text_log]

## API: al_append_native_text_log

Appends a line of text to the message log window and scrolls to the
bottom (if the line would not be visible otherwise). This works like
printf. A line is continued until you add a newline character.

If the window is NULL then this function will fall back to calling
printf. This makes it convenient to support logging to a window or
a terminal.

## API: al_get_native_dialog_event_source

Get an event source for a native window. The possible events are:

ALLEGRO_EVENT_NATIVE_DIALOG_CLOSE
  ~ The close button of the window has been pressed. Only supported
    for windows created with [al_open_native_text_log].

## API: al_get_allegro_native_dialog_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].
