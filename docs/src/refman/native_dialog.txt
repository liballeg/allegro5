# Native dialogs support

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_dialog.

~~~~c
 #include <allegro5/allegro_native_dialog.h>
~~~~

## API: ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER

Opaque handle to a native file dialog.

## API: ALLEGRO_TEXTLOG

Opaque handle to a text log window.

## API: al_init_native_dialog_addon

Initialise the native dialog addon.

Returns true on success, false on error.

Since: 5.0.9, 5.1.0

> *Note:* Prior to Allegro 5.1.0 native dialog functions could be called
without explicit initialisation, but that is now deprecated.
Future functionality may require explicit initialisation.
An exception is [al_show_native_message_box], which may be useful to show
an error message if Allegro fails to initialise.

See also: [al_shutdown_native_dialog_addon]

## API: al_is_native_dialog_addon_initialized

Returns true if the native dialog addon is initialized, otherwise returns false.

Since: 5.2.6

## API: al_shutdown_native_dialog_addon

Shut down the native dialog addon.

Since: 5.0.9, 5.1.5

See also: [al_init_native_dialog_addon]

## API: al_create_native_file_dialog

Creates a new native file dialog.  You should only have one such dialog opened
at a time.

Parameters:

- `initial_path`: The initial search path and filename. Can be NULL.
  To start with a blank file name the string should end with a directory
  separator (this should be the common case).

- `title`: Title of the dialog.

- `patterns`: A string containing newline separated sets of patterns to match.
  A pattern is either a shell-style glob pattern (e.g. `"*.txt"`) or a MIME
  type (e.g. `"image/png"`). Not all platforms support both (and some don't
  even support globs), so a portable solution is to specify a MIME type and
  simple style globs which Allegro will pick from to match what the platform
  supports (e.g. do `"image/png;*.png"`). Multiple patterns are separated
  using a semicolon. If the platform does not provide support for patterns,
  this parameter is ignored. Here are some example patterns:

    - `"*.txt"` -- defines a single filter, matching `*.txt` files.
    - `"*.txt;*.md"` -- like above, but matching two types of files.
    - `"Text files (*.txt, *.md) *.txt;*.md"` -- like above, but with a custom
      description (separated from the patterns using a space).
    - `"Text files *.txt\nPNG images image/png;*.png"` -- defines two filters,
      with the second filter using a MIME type and extension at the same time.

   > *Note:* Windows does not support MIME types. Android supports only MIME
   > types. Instead of file patterns, MacOS supports extensions, so matching
   > based on filename beyond file type does not work. Allegro will parse your
   > file pattern to try to extract the file extension. MacOS also supports
   > MIME types, which behave more predictably. MacOS does not support detailed
   > descriptions or multiple pattern sets, Allegro will strip the detailed
   > descriptions and concatenate all patterns into one list.

- `mode`: 0, or a combination of the following flags:

ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FILE_MUST_EXIST
:   If supported by the native dialog, it will not allow entering new names,
    but just allow existing files to be selected. Else it is ignored.

ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SAVE
:   If the native dialog system has a different dialog for saving (for example
    one which allows creating new directories), it is used. Else it is ignored.

ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FOLDER
:   If there is support for a separate dialog to select a folder instead of a
    file, it will be used.

ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_PICTURES
:   If a different dialog is available for selecting pictures, it is used. Else
    it is ignored.

ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SHOW_HIDDEN
:   If the platform supports it, also hidden files will be shown.

ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_MULTIPLE
:   If supported, allow selecting multiple files.

Returns:

A handle to the dialog which you can pass to
[al_show_native_file_dialog] to display it, and from which you then can
query the results  using [al_get_native_file_dialog_count] and
[al_get_native_file_dialog_path]. When you are done, call
[al_destroy_native_file_dialog] on it.

If a dialog window could not be created then this function returns NULL.

## API: al_show_native_file_dialog

Show the dialog window.  The display may be NULL, otherwise the given display
is treated as the parent if possible.

This function blocks the calling thread until it returns,
so you may want to spawn a thread with [al_create_thread] and
call it from inside that thread.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

> *Note:* On Android, [ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING] and
[ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_RESUME_DRAWING] need to be handled before this function
returns. This means that you must call it from a different thread.

## API: al_get_native_file_dialog_count

Returns the number of files selected, or 0 if the dialog was cancelled.

## API: al_get_native_file_dialog_path

Returns one of the selected paths with index `i`. The index should range
from `0` to the return value of [al_get_native_file_dialog_count] `-1`.

> *Note:* On Android, this function returns a content:// Universal Resource
Identifier instead of a file path due to the constraints of Scoped Storage.
Selected files may be accessed using [al_android_open_fd].

## API: al_destroy_native_file_dialog

Frees up all resources used by the file dialog.

## API: al_show_native_message_box

Show a native GUI message box. This can be used for example to display an error
message if creation of an initial display fails.  The display may be NULL,
otherwise the given display is treated as the parent if possible.

The message box will have a single "OK" button and use the style informative
dialog boxes usually have on the native system. If the `buttons` parameter is
not NULL, you can instead specify the button text in a string, with buttons
separated by a vertical bar (|).

> *Note:* The `buttons` parameter is currently unimplemented on Windows.

The flags available are:

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_WARN
:   The message is a warning.
    This may cause a different icon (or other effects).

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_ERROR
:   The message is an error.

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_QUESTION
:   The message is a question.

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_OK_CANCEL
:   Display a cancel button alongside the "OK" button.
    Ignored if `buttons` is not NULL.

ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_YES_NO
:   Display Yes/No buttons instead of the "OK" button.
    Ignored if `buttons` is not NULL.

[al_show_native_message_box] may be called without Allegro being installed.
This is useful to report an error during initialisation of Allegro itself.

Returns:

- 0 if the dialog window was closed without activating a button.
- 1 if the OK or Yes button was pressed.
- 2 if the Cancel or No button was pressed.

If `buttons` is not NULL, the number of the pressed button is returned, starting
with 1.

All of the remaining parameters must not be NULL.

If a message box could not be created then this returns 0, as if the window
was dismissed without activating a button.

Example:

~~~~c
int button = al_show_native_message_box(
  display,
  "Warning",
  "Are you sure?",
  "If you click yes then you are confirming that \"Yes\" "
  "is your response to the query which you have "
  "generated by the action you took to open this "
  "message box.",
  NULL,
  ALLEGRO_MESSAGEBOX_YES_NO
);
~~~~

## API: al_open_native_text_log

Opens a window to which you can append log messages with
[al_append_native_text_log]. This can be useful for debugging if you don't
want to depend on a console being available.

Use [al_close_native_text_log] to close the window again.

The flags available are:

ALLEGRO_TEXTLOG_NO_CLOSE
:   Prevent the window from having a close button. Otherwise, if the close
    button is pressed, an event is generated; see
    [al_get_native_text_log_event_source].

ALLEGRO_TEXTLOG_MONOSPACE
:   Use a monospace font to display the text.

Returns NULL if there was an error opening the window, or if text log windows
are not implemented on the platform.

> *Note:* On Android, logs can be viewed using logcat.

See also: [al_append_native_text_log], [al_close_native_text_log]

## API: al_close_native_text_log

Closes a message log window opened with [al_open_native_text_log]
earlier.

Does nothing if passed NULL.

See also: [al_open_native_text_log]

## API: al_append_native_text_log

Appends a line of text to the message log window and scrolls to the
bottom (if the line would not be visible otherwise). This works like
printf. A line is continued until you add a newline character.

If the window is NULL then this function will fall back to calling
printf. This makes it convenient to support logging to a window or
a terminal.

## API: al_get_native_text_log_event_source

Get an event source for a text log window. The possible events are:

ALLEGRO_EVENT_NATIVE_DIALOG_CLOSE
:   The window was requested to be closed, either by pressing the close button
    or pressing Escape on the keyboard.
    The user.data1 field will hold a pointer to the [ALLEGRO_TEXTLOG]
    which generated the event.
    The user.data2 field will be 1 if the event was generated as a result of a
    key press; otherwise it will be zero.

## API: al_get_allegro_native_dialog_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].

## Menus

Menus are implemented on Windows, X and OS X.
Menus on X are implemented with GTK, and have a special requirement: you must
set the ALLEGRO_GTK_TOPLEVEL display flag prior to creating the display
which will have menus attached.

A menu can be attached to a single display window or popped up as a context
menu. If you wish to use the same menu on multiple displays or use a sub-menu
as a context menu, you must make a copy via [al_clone_menu] or
[al_clone_menu_for_popup].

Top level items in a non-popup menu must have at least one sub-item, or the
behavior is undefined.

Each menu item can be given an ID of any 16-bit integer greater than zero. When
a user clicks on a menu item, an event will be generated only if it has an ID.
This ID should be unique per menu; if you duplicate IDs, then there will be no
way for you to determine exactly which item generated the event.

There are many functions that take `pos` as a parameter used for locating a
particular menu item. In those cases, it represents one of two things: an ID
or a zero-based index. Any value greater than zero will always be treated as an ID.
Anything else (including zero) will be considered an index based on the absolute
value. In other words, 0 is the first menu item, -1 is the second menu item, -2
is the third menu item, and so on.

The event type is `ALLEGRO_EVENT_MENU_CLICK`. It contains three fields:

~~~~c
event.user.data1 = id;
event.user.data2 = (intptr_t) display;
event.user.data3 = (intptr_t) menu;
~~~~

The `display` and `menu` may be NULL if it was not possible to tell exactly
which item generated the event.

A basic example:

~~~~c
 #define FILE_EXIT_ID 1

ALLEGRO_MENU *menu = al_create_menu();
ALLEGRO_MENU *file_menu = al_create_menu();
al_append_menu_item(file_menu, "Exit", FILE_EXIT_ID, 0, NULL, NULL);
al_append_menu_item(menu, "File", 0, 0, NULL, file_menu);
al_set_display_menu(display, menu);

al_register_event_source(queue, al_get_default_menu_event_source());
al_wait_for_event(queue, &event);

if (event.type == ALLEGRO_EVENT_MENU_CLICK) {
   if (event.user.data1 == FILE_EXIT_ID) {
      exit_program();
   }
}
~~~~

Because there is no "DISPLAY_DESTROYED" event, you must call
al_set_display_menu(display, NULL) before destroying any display with a
menu attached, to avoid leaking resources.

### API: ALLEGRO_MENU

An opaque data type that represents a menu that contains menu items.
Each of the menu items may optionally include a sub-menu.

### API: ALLEGRO_MENU_INFO

A structure that defines how to create a complete menu system. For
standard menu items, the following format is used:

       { caption, id, flags, icon }

For special items, these macros are helpful:

~~~~c
ALLEGRO_START_OF_MENU(caption, id)
ALLEGRO_MENU_SEPARATOR
ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU
~~~~

A well-defined menu will begin with `ALLEGRO_START_OF_MENU`, contain
one or more menu items, and end with `ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU`. A menu
may contain sub-menus. An example:

~~~~c
ALLEGRO_MENU_INFO menu_info[] = {
   ALLEGRO_START_OF_MENU("&File", 1),
      { "&Open", 2, 0, NULL },
      ALLEGRO_START_OF_MENU("Open &Recent...", 3),
         { "Recent 1", 4, 0, NULL },
         { "Recent 2", 5, 0, NULL },
         ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU,
      ALLEGRO_MENU_SEPARATOR,
      { "E&xit", 6, 0, NULL },
      ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU,
   ALLEGRO_START_OF_MENU("&Help", 7),
      {"&About", 8, 0, NULL },
      ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU,
   ALLEGRO_END_OF_MENU
};

ALLEGRO_MENU *menu = al_build_menu(menu_info);
~~~~

If you prefer, you can build the menu without the structure
by using [al_create_menu] and [al_insert_menu_item].

See also: [al_build_menu]

### API: al_create_menu

Creates a menu container that can hold menu items.

Returns `NULL` on failure.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_create_popup_menu], [al_build_menu]

### API: al_create_popup_menu

Creates a menu container for popup menus. Only the root (outermost)
menu should be created with this function. Sub menus of popups should
be created with [al_create_menu].

Returns `NULL` on failure.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_create_menu], [al_build_menu]

### API: al_build_menu

Builds a menu based on the specifications of a sequence of
`ALLEGRO_MENU_INFO` elements.

Returns a pointer to the root `ALLEGRO_MENU`, or `NULL` on failure.
To gain access to the other menus and items, you will need to
search for them using [al_find_menu_item].

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [ALLEGRO_MENU_INFO], [al_create_menu], [al_create_popup_menu]

### API: al_append_menu_item

Appends a menu item to the end of the menu. See [al_insert_menu_item]
for more information.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_insert_menu_item], [al_remove_menu_item]

### API: al_insert_menu_item

Inserts a menu item at the spot specified. See the introductory text for a
detailed explanation of how the `pos` parameter is interpreted.

The `parent` menu can be a popup menu or a regular menu. To underline
one character in the `title`, prefix it with an ampersand.

The `flags` can be any combination of:

ALLEGRO_MENU_ITEM_DISABLED
:   The item is "grayed out" and cannot be selected.

ALLEGRO_MENU_ITEM_CHECKBOX
:   The item is a check box. This flag can only be set at the time the
    menu is created. If a check box is clicked, it will automatically be
    toggled.

ALLEGRO_MENU_ITEM_CHECKED
:   The item is checked. If set, ALLEGRO_MENU_ITEM_CHECKBOX will automatically
    be set as well.

The `icon` is not yet supported.

The `submenu` parameter indicates that this item contains a child menu.
The child menu must have previously been created with `al_create_menu`,
and not be associated with any other menu.

Returns `true` on success.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_append_menu_item], [al_remove_menu_item]

### API: al_remove_menu_item

Removes the specified item from the menu and destroys it. If the item
contains a sub-menu, it too is destroyed. Any references to it are invalidated.
If you want to preserve that sub-menu, you should first make a copy with [al_clone_menu].

This is safe to call on a menu that is currently being displayed.

Returns `true` if an item was removed.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_append_menu_item], [al_insert_menu_item], [al_destroy_menu]

### API: al_clone_menu

Makes a copy of a menu so that it can be reused on another display. The
menu being cloned can be anything: a regular menu, a popup menu, or a
sub-menu.

Returns the cloned menu.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_clone_menu_for_popup]

### API: al_clone_menu_for_popup

Exactly like [al_clone_menu], except that the copy is for a popup menu.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_clone_menu]

### API: al_destroy_menu

Destroys an entire menu, including its sub-menus. Any references to it or
a sub-menu are no longer valid. It is safe to call this on a menu that is
currently being displayed.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_remove_menu_item]

### API: al_get_menu_item_caption

Returns the caption associated with the menu item. It is valid as long
as the caption is not modified.

Returns `NULL` if the item was not found.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_set_menu_item_caption]

### API: al_set_menu_item_caption

Updates the menu item caption with the new `caption`. This will invalidate
any previous calls to [al_get_menu_item_caption].

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_get_menu_item_caption]

### API: al_get_menu_item_flags

Returns the currently set flags. See [al_insert_menu_item] for a description
of the available flags.

Returns -1 if the item was not found.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_set_menu_item_flags], [al_toggle_menu_item_flags]

### API: al_set_menu_item_flags

Updates the menu item's flags. See [al_insert_menu_item] for a description
of the available flags.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_get_menu_item_flags], [al_toggle_menu_item_flags]

### API: al_toggle_menu_item_flags

Toggles the specified menu item's flags. See [al_insert_menu_item] for a
description of the available flags.

Returns a bitfield of only the specified flags that are set after the toggle.
A flag that was not toggled will not be returned, even if it is set.
Returns -1 if the id is invalid.

Since: 5.1.0

> *[Unstable API]:* Redundant with `al_get/set_menu_item_flags`.

See also: [al_get_menu_item_flags], [al_set_menu_item_flags]

### API: al_get_menu_item_icon

Returns the icon associated with the menu. It is safe to draw to the returned
bitmap, but you must call [al_set_menu_item_icon] in order for the changes to
be applied.

Returns `NULL` if the item was not found or if it has no icon.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_set_menu_item_icon]

### API: al_set_menu_item_icon

Sets the icon for the specified menu item. The menu assumes ownership of the
`ALLEGRO_BITMAP` and may invalidate the pointer, so you must clone it if you
wish to continue using it.

If a video bitmap is passed, it will automatically be converted to a memory
bitmap, so it is preferable to pass a memory bitmap.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_get_menu_item_icon], [al_clone_bitmap]

### API: al_find_menu

Searches in the `haystack` menu for any submenu with the given `id`. (Note
that this only represents a literal ID, and cannot be used as an index.)

Returns the menu, if found. Otherwise returns `NULL`.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_find_menu_item]

### API: al_find_menu_item

Searches in the `haystack` menu for an item with the given `id`. (Note that
this only represents a literal ID, and cannot be used as an index.)

If `menu` and `index` are not `NULL`, they will be set as the parent menu
containing the item and the zero-based (positive) index of the item. (If the menu item
was not found, then their values are undefined.)

Returns true if the menu item was found.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_find_menu]

### API: al_get_default_menu_event_source

Returns the default event source used for menu clicks. If a menu was not
given its own event source via [al_enable_menu_event_source], then
it will use this default source.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_register_event_source], [al_enable_menu_event_source],
[al_disable_menu_event_source]

### API: al_enable_menu_event_source

Enables a unique event source for this menu. It and all of its sub-menus
will use this event source. (It is safe to call this multiple times on the
same menu.)

Returns the event source.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_register_event_source], [al_get_default_menu_event_source],
[al_disable_menu_event_source]

### API: al_disable_menu_event_source

Disables a unique event source for the menu, causing it to use the
default event source.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_get_default_menu_event_source], [al_enable_menu_event_source]

### API: al_get_display_menu

Returns the menu associated with the `display`, or `NULL` if it does not have
a menu.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_set_display_menu]

### API: al_set_display_menu

Associates the `menu` with the `display` and shows it. If there was a previous
menu associated with the display, it will be destroyed. If you don't want that
to happen, you should first remove the menu with [al_remove_display_menu].

If the menu is already attached to a display, it will not be attached to the
new display. If `menu` is `NULL`, the current menu will still be destroyed.

> *Note:* Attaching a menu may cause the window as available to your application
to be resized! You should listen for a resize event, check how much space was
lost, and resize the window accordingly if you want to maintain your window's
prior size.

Returns true if successful.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_create_menu], [al_remove_display_menu]

### API: al_popup_menu

Displays a context menu next to the mouse cursor. The menu must have been
created with [al_create_popup_menu]. It generates events just like a regular
display menu does. It is possible that the menu will be canceled without any
selection being made.

The `display` parameter indicates which window the menu is associated with
(when you process the menu click event), but does not actually affect where
the menu is located on the screen.

Returns `true` if the context menu was displayed.

> *Note:* On Linux this function will fail if any of the mouse keys are held
down. I.e. it will only reliably work if you handle it in
`ALLEGRO_MOUSE_BUTTON_UP` events and even then only if that event corresponds
to the final mouse button that was pressed.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_create_popup_menu]

### API: al_remove_display_menu

Detaches the menu associated with the display and returns it. The menu
can then be used on a different display.

If you simply want to destroy the active menu, you can call
[al_set_display_menu] with a `NULL` menu.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_set_display_menu]
