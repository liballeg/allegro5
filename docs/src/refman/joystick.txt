# Joystick routines

These functions are declared in the main Allegro header file:

~~~~c
 #include <allegro5/allegro.h>
~~~~

On Windows there are two joystick drivers, a DirectInput one and an Xinput
one. If support for XInput was compiled in, then it can be enabled by
calling al_set_config_value(al_get_system_config(), "joystick", "driver",
"xinput") before calling al_install_joystick, or by setting the same
option in the allegro5.cfg configuration file. The Xinput and DirectInput
drivers are mutually exclusive. The haptics subsystem will use the
same driver as the joystick system does.

## API: ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK

This is an abstract data type representing a physical joystick.

See also: [al_get_joystick]

## API: ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK_STATE

This is a structure that is used to hold a "snapshot" of a
joystick's axes and buttons at a particular instant.
All fields public and read-only.

~~~~c
struct {
   float axis[num_axes];             // -1.0 to 1.0
} stick[num_sticks];
int button[num_buttons];             // 0 to 32767

## API: ALLEGRO_JOYFLAGS

* ALLEGRO_JOYFLAG_DIGITAL  - the stick provides digital input
* ALLEGRO_JOYFLAG_ANALOGUE - the stick provides analogue input

(this enum is a holdover from the old API and may be removed)

## API: al_install_joystick

Install a joystick driver, returning true if successful.  If a
joystick driver was already installed, returns true immediately.

See also: [al_uninstall_joystick]

## API: al_uninstall_joystick

Uninstalls the active joystick driver.  All outstanding [ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK]
structures are invalidated.  If no joystick driver
was active, this function does nothing.

This function is automatically called when Allegro is shut down.

See also: [al_install_joystick]

## API: al_is_joystick_installed

Returns true if [al_install_joystick] was called successfully.

## API: al_reconfigure_joysticks

Allegro is able to cope with users connecting and disconnected joystick devices
on-the-fly.  On existing platforms, the joystick event source will generate an
event of type `ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_CONFIGURATION` when a device is plugged
in or unplugged.  In response, you should call [al_reconfigure_joysticks].

Afterwards, the number returned by [al_get_num_joysticks] may be different,
and the handles returned by [al_get_joystick] may be different or be ordered
differently.

All [ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK] handles remain valid, but handles for disconnected
devices become inactive: their states will no longer update, and
[al_get_joystick] will not return the handle.  Handles for devices which remain
connected will continue to represent the same devices.  Previously inactive
handles may become active again, being reused to represent newly connected
devices.

Returns true if the joystick configuration changed, otherwise returns false.

It is possible that on some systems, Allegro won't be able to generate
`ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_CONFIGURATION` events.  If your game has an input
configuration screen or similar, you may wish to call
[al_reconfigure_joysticks] when entering that screen.

## API: al_get_num_joysticks

Return the number of joysticks currently on the system (or potentially on the
system).  This number can change after [al_reconfigure_joysticks] is called, in
order to support hotplugging.

Returns 0 if there is no joystick driver installed.

See also: [al_get_joystick], [al_get_joystick_active]

## API: al_get_joystick

Get a handle for a joystick on the system.  The number may be from 0 to
[al_get_num_joysticks]-1.  If successful a pointer to a joystick object is
returned, which represents a physical device.  Otherwise NULL is returned.

The handle and the index are only incidentally linked.  After
[al_reconfigure_joysticks] is called, [al_get_joystick] may return handles in a
different order, and handles which represent disconnected devices will not be
returned.

See also: [al_get_num_joysticks], [al_reconfigure_joysticks],
[al_get_joystick_active]

## API: al_release_joystick

This function currently does nothing.

See also: [al_get_joystick]

## API: al_get_joystick_active

Return if the joystick handle is "active", i.e. in the current configuration,
the handle represents some physical device plugged into the system.
[al_get_joystick] returns active handles.  After reconfiguration, active
handles may become inactive, and vice versa.

## API: al_get_joystick_name

Return the name of the given joystick.

See also: [al_get_joystick_stick_name], [al_get_joystick_axis_name],
[al_get_joystick_button_name]

## API: al_get_joystick_stick_name

Return the name of the given "stick".  If the stick doesn't
exist, NULL is returned.

See also: [al_get_joystick_axis_name], [al_get_joystick_num_sticks]

## API: al_get_joystick_axis_name

Return the name of the given axis.  If the axis doesn't exist,
NULL is returned.
Indices begin from 0.

See also: [al_get_joystick_stick_name], [al_get_joystick_num_axes]

## API: al_get_joystick_button_name

Return the name of the given button.  If the button doesn't exist,
NULL is returned.
Indices begin from 0.

See also: [al_get_joystick_stick_name], [al_get_joystick_axis_name],
[al_get_joystick_num_buttons]

## API: al_get_joystick_stick_flags

Return the flags of the given "stick".  If the stick doesn't
exist, NULL is returned.
Indices begin from 0.

See also: [ALLEGRO_JOYFLAGS]

## API: al_get_joystick_num_sticks

Return the number of "sticks" on the given joystick.
A stick has one or more axes.

See also: [al_get_joystick_num_axes], [al_get_joystick_num_buttons]

## API: al_get_joystick_num_axes

Return the number of axes on the given "stick".  If the stick
doesn't exist, 0 is returned.

See also: [al_get_joystick_num_sticks]

## API: al_get_joystick_num_buttons

Return the number of buttons on the joystick.

See also: [al_get_joystick_num_sticks]

## API: al_get_joystick_state

Get the current joystick state.

See also: [ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK_STATE], [al_get_joystick_num_buttons],
[al_get_joystick_num_axes]

## API: al_get_joystick_event_source

Returns the global joystick event source.  All
[joystick events][ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_AXIS] are generated by
this event source.
