# Joystick

## API: ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK

This is an abstract data type representing a physical joystick.

See also: [al_get_joystick]

## API: ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK_STATE

This is a structure that is used to hold a "snapshot" of a
joystick's axes and buttons at a particular instant.
All fields public and read-only.

    struct {
          float axis[num_axes];             // -1.0 to 1.0 
    } stick[num_sticks];
    int button[num_buttons];                // 0 to 32767

## API: ALLEGRO_JOYFLAGS

* ALLEGRO_JOYFLAG_DIGITAL  - the stick provides digital input
* ALLEGRO_JOYFLAG_ANALOGUE - the stick provides analogue input

(this enum is a holdover from the old API and may be removed)

See also: [al_get_joystick_stick_flags]

## API: al_install_joystick

Install a joystick driver, returning true if successful.  If a
joystick driver was already installed, returns true immediately.

See also: [al_uninstall_joystick]

## API: al_uninstall_joystick

Uninstalls the active joystick driver.  All outstanding [ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK]
structures are automatically released.  If no joystick driver
was active, this function does nothing.

This function is automatically called when Allegro is shut down.

See also: [al_install_joystick]

## API: al_get_num_joysticks

Return the number of joysticks on the system (depending on the OS
this may not be accurate).  Returns 0 if there is no joystick driver
installed.

See also: [al_get_joystick]

## API: al_get_joystick

Get a handle for joystick number *num* on the system.  If successful
a pointer to a joystick object is returned.  Otherwise NULL is
returned.

If the joystick was previously 'gotten' (and not yet released)
then the returned pointer will be the same as in previous calls.

See also: [al_get_num_joysticks]

## API: al_release_joystick

Release a previously 'gotten' joystick object.  You do not normally need to do
this explicitly as [al_uninstall_joystick] will automatically release
joysticks.

See also: [al_get_joystick]

## API: al_get_joystick_name

Return the name of the given joystick.

See also: [al_get_joystick_stick_name], [al_get_joystick_axis_name],
[al_get_joystick_button_name]

## API: al_get_joystick_stick_name

Return the name of the given "stick".  If the stick doesn't
exist, NULL is returned.

See also: [al_get_joystick_axis_name], [al_get_joystick_num_sticks]

## API: al_get_joystick_axis_name

Return the name of the given axis.  If the axis doesn't exist,
NULL is returned.

See also: [al_get_joystick_stick_name], [al_get_joystick_num_axes]

## API: al_get_joystick_button_name

Return the name of the given button.  If the button doesn't exist,
NULL is returned.

See also: [al_get_joystick_stick_name], [al_get_joystick_axis_name],
[al_get_joystick_num_buttons]

## API: al_get_joystick_number

Return the joystick number, i.e. the parameter passed to [al_get_joystick].

## API: al_get_joystick_stick_flags

Return the flags of the given "stick".  If the stick doesn't
exist, NULL is returned.

See also: [ALLEGRO_JOYFLAGS]

## API: al_get_joystick_num_sticks

Return the number of "sticks" on the given joystick.
A stick has one or more axes.

See also: [al_get_joystick_num_axes], [al_get_joystick_num_buttons]

## API: al_get_joystick_num_axes

Return the number of axes on the given "stick".  If the stick
doesn't exist, 0 is returned.

See also: [al_get_joystick_num_sticks]

## API: al_get_joystick_num_buttons

Return the number of buttons on the joystick.

See also: [al_get_joystick_num_sticks]

## API: al_get_joystick_state

Get the current joystick state.

See also: [ALLEGRO_JOYSTICK_STATE], [al_get_joystick_num_buttons],
[al_get_joystick_num_axes]

## API: al_get_joystick_event_source

Retrieve the associated event source.
