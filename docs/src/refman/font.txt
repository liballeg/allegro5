## General font routines

### API: A5O_FONT

A handle identifying any kind of font. Usually you will create it with
[al_load_font] which supports loading all kinds of TrueType fonts supported by
the FreeType library. If you instead pass the filename of a bitmap file, it will
be loaded with [al_load_bitmap] and a font in Allegro's bitmap font format will
be created from it with [al_grab_font_from_bitmap].

### API: A5O_GLYPH

A structure containing the properties of a character in a font.

~~~~c
typedef struct A5O_GLYPH {
   A5O_BITMAP *bitmap;   // the bitmap the character is on
   int x;                    // the x position of the glyph on bitmap
   int y;                    // the y position of the glyph on bitmap
   int w;                    // the width of the glyph in pixels
   int h;                    // the height of the glyph in pixels
   int kerning;              // pixels of kerning (see below)
   int offset_x;             // x offset to draw the glyph at
   int offset_y;             // y offset to draw the glyph at
   int advance;              // number of pixels to advance after this character
} A5O_GLYPH;
~~~~

bitmap may be a sub-bitmap in the case of color fonts. Bitmap can also be NULL
in which case nothing should be drawn (sometimes true for whitespace characters
in TTF fonts).

kerning should be added to the x position you draw to if you want your text
kerned and depends on which codepoints [al_get_glyph] was called with.

Glyphs are tightly packed onto the bitmap, so you need to add offset_x and
offset_y to your draw position for the text to look right.

advance is the number of pixels to add to your x position to advance to the
next character in a string and includes kerning.

Since: 5.2.1

> *[Unstable API]:* This API is new and subject to refinement.

See also: [al_get_glyph]

### API: al_init_font_addon

Initialise the font addon.

Note that if you intend to load bitmap fonts, you will need to initialise
allegro_image separately (unless you are using another library to load images).

Similarly, if you wish to load truetype-fonts, do not forget to also call
[al_init_ttf_addon].

Returns true on success, false on failure.
On the 5.0 branch, this function has no return value.  You may wish to avoid
checking the return value if your code needs to be compatible with Allegro
5.0.  Currently, the function will never return false.

See also: [al_init_image_addon], [al_init_ttf_addon], [al_shutdown_font_addon]

### API: al_is_font_addon_initialized

Returns true if the font addon is initialized, otherwise returns false.

Since: 5.2.6

See also: [al_init_font_addon], [al_shutdown_font_addon]

### API: al_shutdown_font_addon

Shut down the font addon. This is done automatically at program exit,
but can be called any time the user wishes as well.

See also: [al_init_font_addon]

### API: al_load_font

Loads a font from disk. This will use [al_load_bitmap_font_flags] if you pass
the name of a known bitmap format, or else [al_load_ttf_font].

The flags parameter is passed through to either of those functions.
Bitmap and TTF fonts are also affected by the current
[bitmap flags][al_set_new_bitmap_flags] at the time the font is loaded.

See also: [al_destroy_font], [al_init_font_addon], [al_register_font_loader],
[al_load_bitmap_font_flags], [al_load_ttf_font]

### API: al_destroy_font

Frees the memory being used by a font structure.
Does nothing if passed NULL.

See also: [al_load_font]

### API: al_register_font_loader

Informs Allegro of a new font file type, telling it how to load files of
this format.

The `extension` should include the leading dot ('.') character.
It will be matched case-insensitively.

The `load_font` argument may be NULL to unregister an entry.

Returns true on success, false on error.
Returns false if unregistering an entry that doesn't exist.

See also: [al_init_font_addon]

### API: al_get_font_line_height

Returns the usual height of a line of text in the specified font. For bitmap
fonts this is simply the height of all glyph bitmaps. For truetype fonts it
is whatever the font file specifies. In particular, some special glyphs may be
higher than the height returned here.

If the X is the position you specify to draw text, the meaning of
ascent and descent and the line height is like in the figure below.

    X------------------------
        /\         |        |
       /  \        |        |
      /____\       ascent   |
     /      \      |        |
    /        \     |        height
    ----------------        |
                   |        |
                   descent  |
                   |        |
    -------------------------

See also: [al_get_text_width], [al_get_text_dimensions]

### API: al_get_font_ascent

Returns the ascent of the specified font.

See also: [al_get_font_descent], [al_get_font_line_height]

### API: al_get_font_descent

Returns the descent of the specified font.

See also: [al_get_font_ascent], [al_get_font_line_height]

### API: al_get_text_width

Calculates the length of a string in a particular font, in pixels.

See also: [al_get_ustr_width], [al_get_font_line_height],
[al_get_text_dimensions]

### API: al_get_ustr_width

Like [al_get_text_width] but expects an A5O_USTR.

See also: [al_get_text_width], [al_get_ustr_dimensions]

### API: al_draw_text

Writes the NUL-terminated string `text` onto the target bitmap at position `x`,
`y`, using the specified `font`.

The `flags` parameter can be 0 or one of the following flags:

- A5O_ALIGN_LEFT - Draw the text left-aligned (same as 0).
- A5O_ALIGN_CENTRE - Draw the text centered around the given position.
- A5O_ALIGN_RIGHT - Draw the text right-aligned to the given position.

It can also be combined with this flag:

- A5O_ALIGN_INTEGER - Always draw text aligned to an integer pixel
  position.  This was formerly the default behaviour.  Since: 5.0.8, 5.1.4

This function does not support newline characters (`\n`),
but you can use [al_draw_multiline_text] for multi line text output.

See also: [al_draw_ustr], [al_draw_textf], [al_draw_justified_text],
[al_draw_multiline_text].

### API: al_draw_ustr

Like [al_draw_text], except the text is passed as an A5O_USTR instead of
a NUL-terminated char array.

See also: [al_draw_text], [al_draw_justified_ustr], [al_draw_multiline_ustr]

### API: al_draw_justified_text

Like [al_draw_text], but justifies the string to the region x1-x2.

The `diff` parameter is the maximum amount of horizontal space to
allow between words.  If justisfying the text would exceed `diff` pixels,
or the string contains less than two words, then the string will be drawn
left aligned.

The `flags` parameter can be 0 or one of the following flags:

- A5O_ALIGN_INTEGER - Draw text aligned to integer pixel positions.
  Since: 5.0.8, 5.1.5

See also: [al_draw_justified_textf], [al_draw_justified_ustr]

### API: al_draw_justified_ustr

Like [al_draw_justified_text], except the text is passed as an A5O_USTR
instead of a NUL-terminated char array.

See also: [al_draw_justified_text], [al_draw_justified_textf].

### API: al_draw_textf

Formatted text output, using a printf() style format string.
All parameters have the same meaning as with [al_draw_text] otherwise.

See also: [al_draw_text], [al_draw_ustr]

### API: al_draw_justified_textf

Formatted text output, using a printf() style format string.
All parameters have the same meaning as with [al_draw_justified_text]
otherwise.

See also: [al_draw_justified_text], [al_draw_justified_ustr].

### API: al_get_text_dimensions

Sometimes, the [al_get_text_width] and [al_get_font_line_height]
functions are not enough for exact text placement, so this function
returns some additional information.

Returned variables (all in pixels):

- x, y - Offset to upper left corner of bounding box.
- w, h - Dimensions of bounding box.

Note that glyphs may go to the left and upwards of the X, in which
case x and y will have negative values.

See also: [al_get_text_width], [al_get_font_line_height],
[al_get_ustr_dimensions]

### API: al_get_ustr_dimensions

Like [al_get_text_dimensions], except the text is passed as an A5O_USTR
instead of a NUL-terminated char array.

See also: [al_get_text_dimensions]

### API: al_get_allegro_font_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].

### API: al_get_font_ranges

Gets information about all glyphs contained in a font, as a list of ranges.
Ranges have the same format as with [al_grab_font_from_bitmap].

`ranges_count` is the maximum number of ranges that will be returned.

`ranges` should be an array with room for `ranges_count` * 2 elements. The
even integers are the first unicode point in a range, the odd integers the
last unicode point in a range.

Returns the number of ranges contained in the font (even if it is bigger
than `ranges_count`).

Since: 5.1.4

See also: [al_grab_font_from_bitmap]

### API: al_set_fallback_font

Sets a font which is used instead if a character is not present. Can be
chained, but make sure there is no loop as that would crash the
application! Pass NULL to remove a fallback font again.

Since: 5.1.12

See also: [al_get_fallback_font], [al_draw_glyph], [al_draw_text]

### API: al_get_fallback_font

Retrieves the fallback font for this font or NULL.

Since: 5.1.12

See also: [al_set_fallback_font]

## Per glyph text handling

For some applications Allegro's text drawing functions may not be sufficient.
For example, you would like to give a different color to every letter in a word,
or use different a font for a drop cap.

That is why Allegro supports drawing and getting the dimensions of the 
individual glyphs of a font. A glyph is a particular visual representation of 
a letter, character or symbol in a specific font.

And it's also possible to get the kerning to use between two glyphs. These per 
glyph functions have less overhead than Allegro's per string text drawing and 
dimensioning functions. So, with these functions you can write your own 
efficient and precise custom text drawing functions.

### API: al_draw_glyph

Draws the glyph that corresponds with `codepoint` in the given `color`
using the given `font`. If `font` does not have such a glyph, nothing
will be drawn.

To draw a string as left to right horizontal text you will need to use
[al_get_glyph_advance] to determine the position of each glyph.
For drawing strings in other directions, such as top to down, use
[al_get_glyph_dimensions] to determine the size and position of each glyph.

If you have to draw many glyphs at the same time, use [al_hold_bitmap_drawing]
with true as the parameter, before drawing the glyphs, and then call
[al_hold_bitmap_drawing] again with false as a parameter when done drawing the
glyphs to further enhance performance.

Since: 5.1.12

See also: [al_get_glyph_width], [al_get_glyph_dimensions],
[al_get_glyph_advance].

### API: al_get_glyph_width

This function returns the width in pixels of the glyph that corresponds with
`codepoint` in the font `font`. Returns zero if the font does not have such
a glyph.

Since: 5.1.12

See also: [al_draw_glyph], [al_get_glyph_dimensions], [al_get_glyph_advance].

### API: al_get_glyph_dimensions

Sometimes, the [al_get_glyph_width] or [al_get_glyph_advance] functions are
not enough for exact glyph placement, so this function returns some additional
information, particularly if you want to draw the font vertically.

The function itself returns true if the character was present in `font`
and false if the character was not present in `font`.

Returned variables (all in pixel):

- bbx, bby - Offset to upper left corner of bounding box.
- bbw, bbh - Dimensions of bounding box.

These values are the same as [al_get_text_dimensions] would return for 
a string of a single character equal to the glyph passed to this function.
Note that glyphs may go to the left and upwards of the X, in which
case x and y will have negative values.

If you want to draw a string verticallly, for Japanese or as a game effect, 
then you should leave bby + bbh space between the glyphs in the y direction
for a regular placement.

If you want to draw a string horizontally in an extra compact way,  
then you should leave bbx + bbw space between the glyphs in the x direction
for a compact placement.

In the figure below is an example of what bbx and bby may be like for a `2` 
glyph, and a `g` glyph of the same font compared to the result of 
al_get_glyph_width().

### API: al_get_glyph_advance

This function returns by how much the x position should be advanced
for left to right text drawing when the glyph that corresponds to codepoint1
has been drawn, and the glyph that corresponds to codepoint2 will be the next
to be drawn. This takes into consideration the horizontal advance width of the
glyph that corresponds with codepoint1 as well as the kerning between the
glyphs of codepoint1 and codepoint2.

Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between glyphs in a font,
to obtain a more visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between
two individual glyphs with an offset determined by the author of the font.

If you pass A5O_NO_KERNING as codepoint1 then al_get_glyph_advance
will return 0. this can be useful when drawing the first character of a string 
in a loop.

Pass A5O_NO_KERNING as codepoint2 to get the horizontal advance width
of the glyph that corresponds to codepoint1 without taking any kerning into
consideration. This can be used, for example, when drawing the last character 
of a string in a loop.

This function will return zero if the glyph of codepoint1 is not present
in the `font`. If the glyph of codepoint2 is not present in the font, 
the horizontal advance width of the glyph that corresponds to codepoint1 
without taking any kerning into consideration is returned.

When drawing a string one glyph at the time from the left to the right
with kerning, the x position of the glyph should be incremented by the result
of [al_get_glyph_advance] applied to the previous glyph drawn and
the next glyph to draw.

Note that the return value of this function is a recommended advance for
optimal readability for left to right text determined by the author of the font. 
However, if you like, you may want to draw the glyphs of the font narrower 
or wider to each other than what [al_get_glyph_advance] returns for style 
or effect.

In the figure below is an example of what the result of al_get_glyph_advance
may be like for two glypphs `A` and `l` of the same font that has kerning for 
the "Al" pair, without and with the A5O_NO_KERNING flag.


    al_get_glyph_advance(font, 'A', 'l')
         ___|___                  
        /       \

## Multiline text drawing

### API: al_draw_multiline_text

Like [al_draw_text], but this function supports drawing multiple lines of text.
It will break `text` in lines based on its contents and the `max_width`
parameter. The lines are then layed out vertically depending on the
`line_height` parameter and drawn each as if [al_draw_text] was called
on them.

A newline `\n` in the `text` will cause a "hard" line break after its
occurrence in the string. The text after a hard break is placed on a new line.
Carriage return `\r` is not supported, will not cause a line break, and will
likely be drawn as a square or a space depending on the font.

The `max_width` parameter controls the maximum desired width of the lines.
This function will try to introduce a "soft" line break after the longest
possible series of words that will fit in `max_length` when drawn
with the given `font`. A "soft" line break can occur either on a space or
tab (`\t`) character.

However, it is possible that `max_width` is too small, or the words in `text`
are too long to fit `max_width` when drawn with `font`. In that case, the word
that is too wide will simply be drawn completely on a line by itself. If you
don't want the text that overflows `max_width` to be visible, then use
[al_set_clipping_rectangle] to clip it off and hide it.

The lines `text` was split into will each be drawn using the `font`, `x`, `color`
and `flags` parameters, vertically starting at `y` and with a distance of
`line_height` between them. If `line_height` is zero (`0`), the value returned by
calling [al_get_font_line_height] on `font` will be used as a default instead.

The `flags` A5O_ALIGN_LEFT, A5O_ALIGN_CENTRE, A5O_ALIGN_RIGHT
and A5O_ALIGN_INTEGER will be honoured by this function.

If you want to calculate the size of what this function will draw without actually
drawing it, or if you need a complex and/or custom layout, you can use [al_do_multiline_text].

Since: 5.1.9

See also: [al_do_multiline_text], [al_draw_multiline_ustr],
[al_draw_multiline_textf]

### API: al_draw_multiline_ustr

Like [al_draw_multiline_text], except the text is passed as an A5O_USTR
instead of a NUL-terminated char array.

Since: 5.1.9

See also: [al_draw_multiline_text], [al_draw_multiline_textf],
[al_do_multiline_text]

### API: al_draw_multiline_textf

Formatted text output, using a printf() style format string.
All parameters have the same meaning as with [al_draw_multiline_text] otherwise.

Since: 5.1.9

See also: [al_draw_multiline_text], [al_draw_multiline_ustr],
[al_do_multiline_text]

### API: al_do_multiline_text

This function processes the `text` and splits it into lines as
[al_draw_multiline_text] would, and then calls the callback `cb` once
for every line. This is useful for custom drawing of multiline text,
or for calculating the size of multiline text ahead of time. See the
documentation on [al_draw_multiline_text] for an explanation of the splitting
algorithm.

For every line that this function splits `text` into the callback `cb`
will be called once with the following parameters:

- `line_num` - the number of the line starting from zero and counting up
- `line` - a pointer to the beginning character of the line (see below)
- `size` - the size of the line (0 for empty lines)
- `extra` - the same pointer that was passed to al_do_multiline_text

Note that `line` is *not* guaranteed to be a NUL-terminated string, but will merely
point to a character within `text` or to an empty string in case of an empty line.
If you need a NUL-terminated string, you will have to copy `line` to a buffer
and NUL-terminate it yourself. You will also have to make your own copy if you need
the contents of `line` after `cb` has returned, as `line` is *not* guaranteed to be
valid after that.

If the callback `cb` returns false, al_do_multiline_text will stop immediately, otherwise
it will continue on to the next line.

Since: 5.1.9

See also: [al_draw_multiline_text]

### API: al_do_multiline_ustr

Like [al_do_multiline_text], but using A5O_USTR instead of a
NUL-terminated char array for text.

Since: 5.1.9

See also: [al_draw_multiline_ustr]

## Bitmap fonts

### API: al_grab_font_from_bitmap

Creates a new font from an Allegro bitmap. You can delete the bitmap after the
function returns as the font will contain a copy for itself.

Parameters:

- bmp: The bitmap with the glyphs drawn onto it
- n: Number of unicode ranges in the bitmap.
- ranges: 'n' pairs of first and last unicode point to map glyphs to for
  each range.

The bitmap format is as in the following example, which contains three glyphs
for 1, 2 and 3.

    .............
    . 1 .222.333.
    . 1 .  2.  3.
    . 1 .222.333.
    . 1 .2  .  3.
    . 1 .222.333.
    .............

In the above illustration, the dot is for pixels having the background color. It
is determined by the color of the top left pixel in the bitmap. There should be
a border of at least 1 pixel with this color to the bitmap edge and between all
glyphs.

Each glyph is inside a rectangle of pixels not containing the background
color. The height of all glyph rectangles should be the same, but the width
can vary.

The placement of the rectangles does not matter, except that glyphs are scanned
from left to right and top to bottom to match them to the specified unicode
codepoints.

The glyphs will simply be drawn using [al_draw_bitmap], so usually you will want
the rectangles filled with full transparency and the glyphs drawn in opaque
white.

Examples:

~~~~c
int ranges[] = {32, 126};
al_grab_font_from_bitmap(bitmap, 1, ranges)

int ranges[] = {
    0x0020, 0x007F,  /* ASCII */
    0x00A1, 0x00FF,  /* Latin 1 */
    0x0100, 0x017F,  /* Extended-A */
    0x20AC, 0x20AC}; /* Euro */
al_grab_font_from_bitmap(bitmap, 4, ranges)
~~~~

The first example will grab glyphs for the 95 standard printable ASCII
characters, beginning with the space character (32) and ending with the
tilde character (126). The second example will map the first 96 glyphs
found in the bitmap to ASCII range, the next 95 glyphs to Latin 1, the
next 128 glyphs to Extended-A, and the last glyph to the Euro character.
(This is just the characters found in the Allegro 4 font.)

See also: [al_load_bitmap], [al_grab_font_from_bitmap]

### API: al_load_bitmap_font

Load a bitmap font from a file. This is done by first calling
[al_load_bitmap_flags] and then [al_grab_font_from_bitmap].

If you wanted to load an old A4 font, for example, it would be better to
load the bitmap yourself in order to call [al_convert_mask_to_alpha] on it
before passing it to [al_grab_font_from_bitmap].

See also: [al_load_bitmap_font_flags], [al_load_font], [al_load_bitmap_flags]

### API: al_load_bitmap_font_flags

Like [al_load_bitmap_font] but additionally takes a flags parameter
which is a bitfield containing a combination of the following:

A5O_NO_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA
:  The same meaning as for [al_load_bitmap_flags].

See also: [al_load_bitmap_font], [al_load_bitmap_flags]

### API: al_create_builtin_font

Creates a monochrome bitmap font (8x8 pixels per character).

This font is primarily intended to be used for displaying information in
environments or during early runtime states where no external font data is
available or loaded (e.g. for debugging).

The builtin font contains the following unicode character ranges:

    0x0020 to 0x007F (ASCII)
    0x00A1 to 0x00FF (Latin 1)
    0x0100 to 0x017F (Extended A)
    0x20AC to 0x20AC (euro currency symbol)

Returns NULL on an error.

The font memory must be freed the same way as for any other font,
using [al_destroy_font].

Since: 5.0.8, 5.1.3

## TTF fonts

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_ttf.

~~~~c
 #include <allegro5/allegro_ttf.h>
~~~~

### API: al_init_ttf_addon

Call this after [al_init_font_addon] to make [al_load_font] recognize
".ttf" and other formats supported by [al_load_ttf_font].

Returns true on success, false on failure.

### API: al_is_ttf_addon_initialized

Returns true if the TTF addon is initialized, otherwise returns false.

Since: 5.2.6

See also: [al_init_ttf_addon], [al_shutdown_ttf_addon]

### API: al_shutdown_ttf_addon

Unloads the ttf addon again. You normally don't need to call this.

### API: al_load_ttf_font

Loads a TrueType font from a file using the FreeType library. Quoting
from the FreeType FAQ this means support for many different font
formats:

*TrueType, OpenType, Type1, CID, CFF, Windows FON/FNT, X11 PCF, and
others*

The `size` parameter determines the size the font will be rendered at,
specified in pixels. The standard font size is measured in *units per
EM*, if you instead want to specify the size as the total height of
glyphs in pixels, pass it as a negative value.

> *Note:* If you want to display text at multiple sizes, load the font
multiple times with different size parameters.

The following flags are supported:

* A5O_TTF_NO_KERNING - Do not use any kerning even if the font file
  supports it.

* A5O_TTF_MONOCHROME - Load as a monochrome font (which means no
  anti-aliasing of the font is done).

* A5O_TTF_NO_AUTOHINT - Disable the Auto Hinter which is enabled by default
  in newer versions of FreeType. Since: 5.0.6, 5.1.2

### API: al_load_ttf_font_f

Like [al_load_ttf_font], but the font is read from the file handle. The filename
is only used to find possible additional files next to a font file.

> *Note:* The file handle is owned by the returned A5O_FONT object and must not
be freed by the caller, as FreeType expects to be able to read from it at a
later time.

### API: al_load_ttf_font_stretch

Like [al_load_ttf_font], except it takes separate width and height
parameters instead of a single size parameter.

If the height is a positive value, and the width zero or positive, then font
will be stretched according to those parameters. The width must not be negative
if the height is positive.

As with [al_load_ttf_font], the height may be a negative value to specify
the total height in pixels.  Then the width must also be a negative value, or
zero.

Returns `NULL` if the height is positive while width is negative, or if the
height is negative while the width is positive.

Since: 5.0.6, 5.1.0

See also: [al_load_ttf_font], [al_load_ttf_font_stretch_f]

### API: al_load_ttf_font_stretch_f

Like [al_load_ttf_font_stretch], but the font is read from the file handle. The
filename is only used to find possible additional files next to a font file.

> *Note:* The file handle is owned by the returned A5O_FONT object and must not
be freed by the caller, as FreeType expects to be able to read from it at a
later time.

Since: 5.0.6, 5.1.0

See also: [al_load_ttf_font_stretch]

### API: al_get_allegro_ttf_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].

### API: al_get_glyph

Gets all the information about a glyph, including the bitmap, needed to draw it
yourself. prev_codepoint is the codepoint in the string before the one you want
to draw and is used for kerning. codepoint is the character you want to get info
about. You should clear the 'glyph' structure to 0 with memset before passing it
to this function for future compatibility.

Since: 5.2.1

> *[Unstable API]:* This API is new and subject to refinement.
