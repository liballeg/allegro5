# System routines

These functions are declared in the main Allegro header file:

    #include <allegro5/allegro.h>

## API: al_install_system

Initialize the Allegro system. No other Allegro functions can be called
before this (with one or two exceptions).

The version field should always be set to ALLEGRO_VERSION_INT.

If atexit_ptr is non-NULL, and if hasn't been done already,
[al_uninstall_system] will be registered as an atexit
function.

Returns true if Allegro was successfully initialized by this function
call (or already was initialized previously), false if Allegro cannot
be used.

See also: [al_init]

## API: al_init

Like [al_install_system], but automatically passes in the version and
uses the atexit function visible in the current compilation unit.

See also: [al_install_system]

## API: al_uninstall_system

Closes down the Allegro system.

> Note: al_uninstall_system() can be called without a corresponding
[al_install_system] call, e.g. from atexit().

## API: al_is_system_installed

Returns true if Allegro is initialized, otherwise returns false.

## API: al_get_allegro_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the Allegro library, packed into a single
integer as groups of 8 bits in the form
`(major << 24) | (minor << 16) | (revision << 8) | release`.

You can use code like this to extract them:

    uint32_t version = al_get_allegro_version();
    int major = version >> 24;
    int minor = (version >> 16) & 255;
    int revision = (version >> 8) & 255;
    int release = version & 255;

The `release` number is 0 for an unofficial version and 1 or greater for
an official release. For example "5.0.2[1]" would be the (first) official
5.0.2 release while "5.0.2[0]" would be a compile of a version from the
"5.0.2" branch before the official release.

## API: al_get_standard_path

Gets a system path, depending on the `id` parameter. Some of these paths
may be affected by the organization and application name, so be sure to
set those before calling this function.

The paths are not guaranteed to be unique (e.g., SETTINGS and DATA may be
the same on some platforms), so you should be sure your filenames are unique
if you need to avoid naming collisions. Also, a returned path may not actually
exist on the file system.

ALLEGRO_RESOURCES_PATH
:   If you bundle data in a location relative to your executable, then you
    should use this path to locate that data. On most platforms, this is the
    directory that contains the executable file. 
    
    If ran from an OS X app bundle, then this will point to the internal
    resource directory (<bundle.app>/Contents/Resources). To maintain 
    consistency, if you put your resources into a directory called "data"
    beneath the executable on some other platform (like Windows), then
    you should also create a directory called "data" under the OS X app
    bundle's resource folder.
    
    You should not try to write to this path, as it is very likely read-only.
    
    If you install your resources in some other system directory (e.g., in
    /usr/share or C:\\ProgramData), then you are responsible for keeping track
    of that yourself.    
    
ALLEGRO_TEMP_PATH
:   Path to the directory for temporary files.

ALLEGRO_USER_HOME_PATH
:   This is the user's home directory. You should not normally write files into
    this directory directly, or create any sub folders in it, without explicit
    permission from the user.  One practical application of this path
    would be to use it as the starting place of a file selector in a GUI.
    
ALLEGRO_USER_DOCUMENTS_PATH
:   This location is easily accessible by the user, and is the place
    to store documents and files that the user might want to later open with
    an external program or transfer to another place. 
    
    You should not save files here unless the user expects it, usually by
    explicit permission.

ALLEGRO_USER_DATA_PATH
:   If your program saves any data that the user doesn't need to access 
    externally, then you should place it here. This is generally the least
    intrusive place to store data.
    
ALLEGRO_USER_SETTINGS_PATH
:   If you are saving configuration files (especially if the user may want to
    edit them outside of your program), then you should place them here.
    
ALLEGRO_EXENAME_PATH
:   The full path to the executable.

Returns NULL on failure.  The returned path should be freed with
[al_destroy_path].

See also: [al_set_app_name], [al_set_org_name], [al_destroy_path], [al_set_exe_name]

## API: al_set_exe_name

This override the executable name used by [al_get_standard_path] for
ALLEGRO_EXENAME_PATH and ALLEGRO_RESOURCES_PATH.

One possibility where changing this can be useful is if you use the
Python wrapper. Allegro would then by default think that the system's
Python executable is the current executable - but you can set it to
the .py file being executed instead.

Since: 5.0.6, 5.1.0

## API: al_set_app_name

Sets the global application name.

The application name is used by [al_get_standard_path] to build the full path to
an application's files.

This function may be called before [al_init] or [al_install_system].

See also: [al_get_app_name], [al_set_org_name]

## API: al_set_org_name

Sets the global organization name.

The organization name is used by [al_get_standard_path] to build the full path to
an application's files.

This function may be called before [al_init] or [al_install_system].

See also: [al_get_org_name], [al_set_app_name]

## API: al_get_app_name

Returns the global application name string.

See also: [al_set_app_name]

## API: al_get_org_name

Returns the global organization name string.

See also: [al_set_org_name]

## API: al_get_system_config

Returns the current system configuration structure, or NULL if
there is no active system driver. The returned configuration should
not be destroyed with [al_destroy_config].
This is mainly used for configuring Allegro and its addons.

## API: al_register_assert_handler

Register a function to be called when an internal Allegro assertion fails.
Pass NULL to reset to the default behaviour, which is to do whatever the
standard `assert()` macro does.

Since: 5.0.6, 5.1.0
