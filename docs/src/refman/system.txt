# System routines

These functions are declared in the main Allegro header file:

    #include <allegro5/allegro.h>

## API: al_install_system

Initialize the Allegro system. No other Allegro functions can be called
before this (with one or two exceptions).

The version field should always be set to ALLEGRO_VERSION_INT.

If atexit_ptr is non-NULL, and if hasn't been done already,
[al_uninstall_system] will be registered as an atexit
function.

Returns true if Allegro was successfully initialized by this function
call (or already was initialized previously), false if Allegro cannot
be used.

See also: [al_init]

## API: al_init

Like [al_install_system], but automatically passes in the version and
uses the atexit function visible in the current compilation unit.

See also: [al_install_system]

## API: al_uninstall_system

Closes down the Allegro system.

> Note: al_uninstall_system() can be called without a corresponding
[al_install_system] call, e.g. from atexit().

## API: al_get_allegro_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the Allegro library, packed into a single
integer as groups of 8 bits in the form
`(major << 24) | (minor << 16) | (revision << 8) | release`.

You can use code like this to extract them:

    uint32_t version = al_get_allegro_version();
    int major = version >> 24;
    int minor = (version >> 16) & 255;
    int revision = (version >> 8) & 255;
    int release = version & 255;

The `release` number is 0 for an unofficial version and 1 or greater for
an official release. For example "5.0.2[1]" would be the (first) official
5.0.2 release while "5.0.2[0]" would be a compile of a version from the
"5.0.2" branch before the official release.

## API: al_get_standard_path

Gets a system path, depending on the `id` parameter:

id                            description
----------------------------- ------------------------
ALLEGRO_PROGRAM_PATH          Directory with the executed program.
ALLEGRO_TEMP_PATH             Path to the directory for temporary files.
ALLEGRO_SYSTEM_DATA_PATH      Data path for system-wide installation.
ALLEGRO_USER_DATA_PATH        Data path for per-user installation.
ALLEGRO_USER_HOME_PATH        Path to the user's home directory.
ALLEGRO_USER_SETTINGS_PATH    Path to per-user settings directory.
ALLEGRO_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_PATH  Path to system-wide settings directory.
ALLEGRO_EXENAME_PATH          The full path to the executable. 


Returns NULL on failure.  The returned path should be freed with
[al_destroy_path].

See also: [al_set_app_name], [al_set_org_name], [al_destroy_path]

## API: al_set_app_name

Sets the global application name.

The application name is used by [al_get_standard_path] to build the full path to
an application's files.

This function may be called before [al_init] or [al_install_system].

See also: [al_get_app_name], [al_set_org_name]

## API: al_set_org_name

Sets the global organization name.

The organization name is used by [al_get_standard_path] to build the full path to
an application's files.

This function may be called before [al_init] or [al_install_system].

See also: [al_get_org_name], [al_set_app_name]

## API: al_get_app_name

Returns the global application name string.

See also: [al_set_app_name]

## API: al_get_org_name

Returns the global organization name string.

See also: [al_set_org_name]

## API: al_get_system_driver

Returns the currently active system driver, or NULL.

## API: al_get_system_config

Returns the current system configuration structure, or NULL if
there is no active system driver.
This is mainly used for configuring Allegro and its addons.
