# Audio codecs addon

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_acodec.

    #include <allegro5/allegro_acodec.h>

## API: al_init_acodec_addon

This function registers all the known audio file type handlers for
[al_load_sample], [al_save_sample], [al_load_audio_stream], etc.

Depending on what libraries are available, the full set of recognised
extensions is: .wav, .flac, .ogg, .it, .mod, .s3m, .xm.

*Limitations:*

- Saving is only supported for wav files.

- Wav file loader currently only supports 8/16 bit little endian PCM files.
16 bits are used when saving wav files. Use flac files if more precision is
required.

- Module files (.it, .mod, .s3m, .xm) are often composed with streaming in mind,
and sometimes cannot be easily rendered into a finite length sample. Therefore
they cannot be loaded with [al_load_sample]/[al_load_sample_f] and must be
streamed with [al_load_audio_stream] or [al_load_audio_stream_f].

Return true on success.

## API: al_get_allegro_acodec_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].
