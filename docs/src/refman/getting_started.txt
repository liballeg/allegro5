# Getting started guide

## Introduction

Welcome to Allegro 5!

This short guide should point you at the parts of the API that you'll
want to know about first.  It's not a tutorial, as there isn't much
discussion, only links into the manual.  The rest you'll have to discover for
yourself.  Read the examples, and ask questions at [Allegro.cc].

There is an unofficial tutorial at [the wiki]. Be aware that, being on
the wiki, it may be a little out of date, but the changes should be
minor. Hopefully more will sprout when things stabilise, as they did for
earlier versions of Allegro.

## Structure of the library and its addons

Allegro 5.0 is divided into a core library and multiple addons.  The addons
are bundled together and built at the same time as the core, but they are
distinct and kept in separate libraries.  The core doesn't depend on anything
in the addons, but addons may depend on the core and other addons and
additional third party libraries.

Here are the addons and their dependencies:

    allegro_main -> allegro

    allegro_image -> allegro
    allegro_primitives -> allegro
    allegro_color -> allegro

    allegro_font -> allegro
    allegro_ttf -> allegro_font -> allegro

    allegro_audio -> allegro
    allegro_acodec -> allegro_audio -> allegro
    allegro_video -> allegro_audio -> allegro

    allegro_memfile -> allegro
    allegro_physfs -> allegro

    allegro_native_dialog -> allegro

The header file for the core library is `allegro5/allegro.h`.  The header
files for the addons are named `allegro5/allegro_image.h`, `allegro5/allegro_font.h`,
etc. The allegro_main addon does not have a header file.

## The main function

For the purposes of cross-platform compatibility Allegro puts some requirements
on your main function. First, you must include the core header
(`allegro5/allegro.h`) in the same file as your main function. Second, if your
main function is inside a C++ file, then it must have this signature:
`int main(int argc, char **argv)`. Third, if you're using C/C++ then you need
to link with the allegro_main addon when building your program.

## Initialisation

Before using Allegro you must call [al_init].  Some addons have their own
initialisation, e.g. [al_init_image_addon], [al_init_font_addon],
[al_init_ttf_addon].

To receive input, you need to initialise some subsystems like
[al_install_keyboard], [al_install_mouse], [al_install_joystick].

## Opening a window

[al_create_display] will open a window and return an [A5O_DISPLAY].

To clear the display, call [al_clear_to_color].  Use [al_map_rgba] or
[al_map_rgba_f] to obtain an [A5O_COLOR] parameter.

Drawing operations are performed on a backbuffer.  To make the operations
visible, call [al_flip_display].

## Display an image

To load an image from disk, you need to have initialised the image I/O
addon with [al_init_image_addon].  Then use [al_load_bitmap], which returns an
[A5O_BITMAP].

Use [al_draw_bitmap], [al_draw_scaled_bitmap] or
[al_draw_scaled_rotated_bitmap] to draw the image to the backbuffer.
Remember to call [al_flip_display].

## Changing the drawing target

Notice that [al_clear_to_color] and [al_draw_bitmap] didn't take destination
parameters: the destination is implicit.  Allegro remembers the current
"target bitmap" for the current thread.  To change the target bitmap, call
[al_set_target_bitmap].

The backbuffer of the display is also a bitmap.  You can get it with
[al_get_backbuffer] and then restore it as the target bitmap.

Other bitmaps can be created with [al_create_bitmap], with options which can
be adjusted with [al_set_new_bitmap_flags] and [al_set_new_bitmap_format].

## Event queues and input

Input comes from multiple sources: keyboard, mouse, joystick, timers, etc.
Event queues aggregate events from all these sources, then you can query
the queue for events.

Create an event queue with [al_create_event_queue], then tell input sources
to place new events into that queue using [al_register_event_source].  The
usual input event sources can be retrieved with [al_get_keyboard_event_source],
[al_get_mouse_event_source] and [al_get_joystick_event_source].

Events can be retrieved with [al_wait_for_event] or [al_get_next_event].
Check the event type and other fields of [A5O_EVENT] to react to the
input.

Displays are also event sources, which emit events when they are resized.
You'll need to set the A5O_RESIZABLE flag with [al_set_new_display_flags]
before creating the display, then register the display with an event queue.
When you get a resize event, call [al_acknowledge_resize].

Timers are event sources which "tick" periodically, causing an event to be
inserted into the queues that the timer is registered with.  Create some with
[al_create_timer].

[al_get_time] and [al_rest] are more direct ways to deal with time.

## Displaying some text

To display some text, initialise the image and font addons with
[al_init_image_addon] and [al_init_font_addon], then load a bitmap font with
[al_load_font].  Use [al_draw_text] or [al_draw_textf].

For TrueType fonts, you'll need to initialise the TTF font addon with
[al_init_ttf_addon] and load a TTF font with [al_load_ttf_font].

## Drawing primitives

The primitives addon provides some handy routines to draw lines
([al_draw_line]), rectangles ([al_draw_rectangle]), circles
([al_draw_circle]), etc.

## Blending

To draw translucent or tinted images or primitives, change the blender state
with [al_set_blender].

As with [al_set_target_bitmap], this changes Allegro's internal state (for
the current thread).  Often you'll want to save some part of the state and
restore it later.  The functions [al_store_state] and [al_restore_state]
provide a convenient way to do that.

## Sound

Use [al_install_audio] to initialize sound. To load any sample formats, you
will need to initialise the acodec addon with [al_init_acodec_addon].

After that, you can simply use [al_reserve_samples] and pass the number of
sound effects typically playing at the same time. Then load your sound effects
with [al_load_sample] and play them with [al_play_sample]. To stream large
pieces of music from disk, you can use [al_load_audio_stream] so the whole piece
will not have to be pre-loaded into memory.

If the above sounds too simple and you can't help but think about clipping and
latency issues, don't worry. Allegro gives you full control over how much or
little you want its sound system to do. The [al_reserve_samples] function
mentioned above only sets up a default mixer and a number of sample instances
but you don't need to use it.

Instead, to get a "direct connection" to the sound system you would use an
[A5O_VOICE] (but depending on the platform only one such voice is guaranteed
to be available and it might require a specific format of audio data). Therefore
all sound can be first routed through an [A5O_MIXER] which is connected to
such a voice (or another mixer) and will mix together all sample data fed to it.

You can then directly stream real-time sample data to a mixer or a voice using
an [A5O_AUDIO_STREAM] or play complete sounds using an [A5O_SAMPLE_INSTANCE].
The latter simply points to an [A5O_SAMPLE] and will stream it for you.

## Unstable API

Some of Allegro's API is marked as unstable, which means that in future versions
of Allegro it may change or even be removed entirely! If you want to experiment
with the unstable API, define `A5O_UNSTABLE` macro before including Allegro's
headers.

Note that when you define that macro, the version check performed by
[al_install_system] and [al_init] becomes more scrict. See documentation of
those functions for details.

## Not the end

There's a heap of stuff we haven't even mentioned yet.

Enjoy!
