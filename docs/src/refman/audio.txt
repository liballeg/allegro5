## Basic Audio

In order to just play some sounds (called samples in Allegro) and background
music, here's how to quick start with Allegro's audio addon: Call
[al_reserve_samples] with the number of samples you'd like to be able to play
simultaneously (don't forget to call [al_install_audio] beforehand). If these
succeed, you can now call [al_play_sample], with data obtained by
[al_load_sample], for example (don't forget to [initialize the acodec
addon][al_init_acodec_addon]). In order to stop samples, you can use the
[ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID] that al_play_sample returns.

If you want to play large audio files (e.g. background music) without loading
the whole file at once you can use [al_play_audio_stream] (after calling
[al_reserve_samples]). This will load and play an `ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM`. Note
that the basic API only supports on such audio stream playing at once.

### API: ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID

An ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID represents a sample being played via [al_play_sample].
It can be used to later sALLEGRO_BITMAP_WRAPtop the sample with [al_stop_sample]. The underlying
ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE can be extracted using [al_lock_sample_id].

### API: al_install_audio

Install the audio subsystem.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

> Note: most users will call [al_reserve_samples] and [al_init_acodec_addon]
after this.

See also: [al_reserve_samples], [al_uninstall_audio], [al_is_audio_installed],
[al_init_acodec_addon]

### API: al_uninstall_audio

Uninstalls the audio subsystem.

See also: [al_install_audio]

### API: al_is_audio_installed

Returns true if [al_install_audio] was called previously and returned
successfully.

### API: al_reserve_samples

Reserves a number of sample instances, attaching them to the default mixer.
If no default mixer is set when this function is called, then it will create one
and attach it to the default voice. If no default voice has been set, it, too,
will be created.

If you call this function a second time with a smaller number of samples, then
the excess internal sample instances will be destroyed causing some sounds to
stop and some instances returned by [al_lock_sample_id] to be invalidated.

This diagram illustrates the structures that are set up:

                                          sample instance 1
                                        / sample instance 2
    default voice <-- default mixer <---         .
                                        \        .
                                          sample instance N

Returns true on success, false on error.
[al_install_audio] must have been called first.

See also: [al_set_default_mixer], [al_play_sample]

### API: al_play_sample

Plays a sample on one of the sample instances created by [al_reserve_samples].
Returns true on success, false on failure.
Playback may fail because all the reserved sample instances are currently used.

Parameters:

* gain - relative volume at which the sample is played; 1.0 is normal.
* pan - 0.0 is centred, -1.0 is left, 1.0 is right, or ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE.
* speed - relative speed at which the sample is played; 1.0 is normal.
* loop - ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_ONCE, ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP, or ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_BIDIR
* ret_id - if non-NULL the variable which this points to will be assigned
  an id representing the sample being played. If [al_play_sample] returns `false`,
  then the contents of ret_id are invalid and must not be used as argument to
  other functions.

See also: [al_load_sample], [ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE], [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE],
[ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID], [al_stop_sample], [al_stop_samples], [al_lock_sample_id].

### API: al_stop_sample

Stop the sample started by [al_play_sample].

See also: [al_stop_samples]

### API: al_stop_samples

Stop all samples started by [al_play_sample].

See also: [al_stop_sample]

### API: al_lock_sample_id

Locks a [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID], returning the underlying [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE].
This allows you to adjust the various properties of the instance (such as
volume, pan, etc) while the sound is playing.

This function will return `NULL` if the sound corresponding to the id is no
longer playing.

While locked, `ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID` will be unavailable to additional calls to
[al_play_sample], even if the sound stops while locked. To put the
`ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID` back into the pool for reuse, make sure to call
`al_unlock_sample_id` when you're done with the instance.

See also: [al_play_sample], [al_unlock_sample_id]

Since: 5.2.3

> *[Unstable API]:* New API.

### API: al_unlock_sample_id

Unlocks a [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID], allowing future calls to [al_play_sample] to
reuse it if possible. Note that after the id is unlocked, the
[ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE] that was previously returned by [al_lock_sample_id]
will possibly be playing a different sound, so you should only use it after
locking the id again.

See also: [al_play_sample], [al_lock_sample_id]

Since: 5.2.3

> *[Unstable API]:* New API.

### API: al_play_audio_stream

Loads and plays an audio file from disk as it is needed. This API can only play
one audio stream at a time.

Returns the stream on success, NULL on failure. You must not destroy the
returned stream, it will be automatically destroyed when the addon is shut
down.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

See also: [al_play_audio_stream_f], [al_load_audio_stream]

Since: 5.2.8

> *[Unstable API]:* New API.

### API: al_play_audio_stream_f

Loads and plays an audio file from [ALLEGRO_FILE] stream as it is needed.

The file type is determined by the passed 'ident' parameter, which is a file
name extension including the leading dot.

Returns the stream on success, NULL on failure. You must not destroy the
returned stream, it will be automatically destroyed when the addon is shut
down. On success the file should be considered owned by the audio stream,
and will be closed when the audio stream is destroyed.
On failure the file will be closed.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

See also: [al_play_audio_stream], [al_load_audio_stream_f]

Since: 5.2.8

> *[Unstable API]:* New API.



## Samples

### API: ALLEGRO_SAMPLE

An ALLEGRO_SAMPLE object stores the data necessary for playing pre-defined
digital audio. It holds a user-specified PCM data buffer and information about
its format (data length, depth, frequency, channel configuration). You can have
the same ALLEGRO_SAMPLE playing multiple times simultaneously.

See also: [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE]

### API: al_create_sample

Create a sample data structure from the supplied buffer.
If `free_buf` is true then the buffer will be freed with [al_free] when the
sample data structure is destroyed.  For portability (especially Windows),
the buffer should have been allocated with [al_malloc].  Otherwise you should
free the sample data yourself.

A sample that is referred to by the `samples` parameter refers to a sequence
channel intensities. E.g. if you're making a stereo sample with the `samples`
set to 4, then the layout of the data in `buf` will be:

~~~~
LRLRLRLR
~~~~

Where L and R are the intensities for the left and right channels respectively.
A single sample, then, refers to the LR pair in this example.

To allocate a buffer of the correct size, you can use something like this:

~~~~c
int sample_size = al_get_channel_count(chan_conf)
                  * al_get_audio_depth_size(depth);
int bytes = samples * sample_size;
void *buffer = al_malloc(bytes);
~~~~

See also: [al_destroy_sample], [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH], [ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF]

### API: al_load_sample

Loads a few different audio file formats based on their extension.

Note that this stores the entire file in memory at once, which
may be time consuming.  To read the file as it is needed, 
use [al_load_audio_stream] or [al_play_audio_stream].

Returns the sample on success, NULL on failure.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

See also: [al_register_sample_loader], [al_init_acodec_addon]

### API: al_load_sample_f

Loads an audio file from an [ALLEGRO_FILE] stream into an [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE].
The file type is determined by the passed 'ident' parameter, which is a file
name extension including the leading dot.

Note that this stores the entire file in memory at once, which
may be time consuming.  To read the file as it is needed, 
use [al_load_audio_stream_f] or [al_play_audio_stream_f].

Returns the sample on success, NULL on failure.
The file remains open afterwards.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

See also: [al_register_sample_loader_f], [al_init_acodec_addon]

### API: al_save_sample

Writes a sample into a file.  Currently, wav is
the only supported format, and the extension
must be ".wav".

Returns true on success, false on error.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

See also: [al_save_sample_f], [al_register_sample_saver],
[al_init_acodec_addon]

### API: al_save_sample_f

Writes a sample into a [ALLEGRO_FILE] filestream.  Currently, wav is
the only supported format, and the extension
must be ".wav".

Returns true on success, false on error.
The file remains open afterwards.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

See also: [al_save_sample], [al_register_sample_saver_f],
[al_init_acodec_addon]

### API: al_destroy_sample

Free the sample data structure. If it was created with the `free_buf`
parameter set to true, then the buffer will be freed with [al_free].

This function will stop any sample instances which may be playing the
buffer referenced by the [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE].

See also: [al_destroy_sample_instance], [al_stop_sample], [al_stop_samples]

### API: al_get_sample_channels

Return the channel configuration of the sample.

See also: [ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF], [al_get_sample_depth],
[al_get_sample_frequency], [al_get_sample_length], [al_get_sample_data]

### API: al_get_sample_depth

Return the audio depth of the sample.

See also: [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH], [al_get_sample_channels],
[al_get_sample_frequency], [al_get_sample_length], [al_get_sample_data]

### API: al_get_sample_frequency

Return the frequency (in Hz) of the sample.

See also: [al_get_sample_channels], [al_get_sample_depth],
[al_get_sample_length], [al_get_sample_data]

### API: al_get_sample_length

Return the length of the sample in sample values.

See also: [al_get_sample_channels], [al_get_sample_depth],
[al_get_sample_frequency], [al_get_sample_data]

### API: al_get_sample_data

Return a pointer to the raw sample data.

See also: [al_get_sample_channels], [al_get_sample_depth],
[al_get_sample_frequency], [al_get_sample_length]



## Advanced Audio

For more fine-grained control over audio output, here's a short description of
the basic concepts:

Voices represent audio devices on the system. Basically, every audio output chain
that you want to be heard needs to end up in a voice. As voices are on the
hardware/driver side of things, there is only limited control over their parameters
(frequency, sample format, channel configuration). The number of available voices
is limited as well. Typically, you will only use one voice and attach a mixer to
it. Calling [al_reserve_samples] will do this for you by setting up a default
voice and mixer; it can also be achieved by calling [al_restore_default_mixer].
Although you *can* attach sample instances and audio streams directly to a voice
without using a mixer, it is, as of now, not recommended. In contrast to mixers,
you can only attach a single object to a voice anyway.

Mixers mix several sample instances and/or audio streams into a single output
buffer, converting sample data with differing formats according to their output
parameters (frequency, depth, channels) in the process. In order to play several
samples/streams at once reliably, you will need at least one mixer. A mixer that
is not (indirectly) attached to a voice will remain silent. For most use cases,
one (default) mixer attached to a single voice will be sufficient. You may attach
mixers to other mixers in order to create complex audio chains.

Samples ([ALLEGRO_SAMPLE]) just represent "passive" buffers for sample data in
memory. In order to play a sample, a sample instance ([ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE])
needs to be created and attached to a mixer (or voice). Sample instances control
*how* the underlying samples are played. Several playback parameters (position,
speed, gain, pan, playmode, playing/paused) can be adjusted.
Particularly, multiple instances may be created from the same sample, e.g. with
different parameters.

Audio streams ([ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM]) are similar to sample instances insofar
as they respond to the same playback parameters and have to be attached to
mixers or voices. A single audio stream can only be played once simultaneously.

For example, consider the following configuration of the audio system.

~~~~c
ALLEGRO_VOICE* voice = al_create_voice(44100, ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT16,
    ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_2);

ALLEGRO_MIXER* mixer_1 = al_create_mixer(44100, ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_FLOAT32,
    ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_2);
ALLEGRO_MIXER* mixer_2 = al_create_mixer(44100, ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_FLOAT32,
    ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_2);

/* Load a stream, the stream starts in a playing state and just needs
 * to be attached to actually output sound. */
ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM* stream = al_load_audio_stream("music.ogg", 4, 2048);

/* The sample needs sample instances to output sound. */
ALLEGRO_SAMPLE* sample = al_load_sample("sound.wav")
ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE* instance_1 = al_create_sample_instance(sample);
ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE* instance_2 = al_create_sample_instance(sample);

/* Attach everything up (see diagram). */
al_attach_mixer_to_voice(mixer_1, voice);
al_attach_mixer_to_mixer(mixer_2, mixer_1);
al_attach_audio_stream_to_mixer(stream, mixer_1);
al_attach_sample_instance_to_mixer(instance_1, mixer_2);
al_attach_sample_instance_to_mixer(instance_2, mixer_2);

/* Play two copies of the sound simultaneously. */
al_set_sample_instance_playing(instance_1, true);
al_set_sample_instance_playing(instance_2, true);
~~~~

![*An example configuration of the audio system to play music and a
sound.*](images/audio.png)

Since we have two mixers, with the sample instances connected to a different
mixer than the audio stream, you can control the volume of all the instances
independently from the music by setting the gain of the mixer / stream. Having
two sample instances lets you play two copies of the sample simultaneously.

With this in mind, another look at [al_reserve_samples] and [al_play_sample] is
due: What the former does internally is to create a specified number of sample
instances that are "empty" at first, i.e. with no sample data set. When
al_play_sample is called, it'll use one of these internal sample instances that
is not currently playing to play the requested sample. All of these sample
instances will be attached to the default mixer, which can be changed via
[al_set_default_mixer].



## Sample instances

### API: ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE

An ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE object represents a playable instance of a predefined
sound effect.
It holds information about how the effect should be played: These playback
parameters consist of the looping mode, loop start/end points, playing position,
speed, gain, pan and the playmode. Whether a sample instance is currently playing
or paused is also one of its properties.

An instance uses the data from an [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE] object. Multiple instances may
be created from the same ALLEGRO_SAMPLE. An ALLEGRO_SAMPLE must not be
destroyed while there are instances which reference it.

To actually produce audio output, an ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE must be attached to an
[ALLEGRO_MIXER] which eventually reaches an [ALLEGRO_VOICE] object.

See also: [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE]

### API: al_create_sample_instance

Creates a sample instance, using the supplied sample data. The instance must be
attached to a mixer (or voice) in order to actually produce output.

The argument may be NULL. You can then set the sample data later with
[al_set_sample].

See also: [al_destroy_sample_instance]

### API: al_destroy_sample_instance

Detaches the sample instance from anything it may be attached to and frees
it (the sample data, i.e. its ALLEGRO_SAMPLE, is *not* freed!).

See also: [al_create_sample_instance]

### API: al_play_sample_instance

Play the sample instance.
Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_stop_sample_instance]

### API: al_stop_sample_instance

Stop an sample instance playing.

See also: [al_play_sample_instance]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_channels

Return the channel configuration of the sample instance's sample data.

See also: [ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF].

### API: al_get_sample_instance_depth

Return the audio depth of the sample instance's sample data.

See also: [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH].

### API: al_get_sample_instance_frequency

Return the frequency (in Hz) of the sample instance's sample data.

### API: al_get_sample_instance_length

Return the length of the sample instance in sample values. This property may
differ from the length of the instance's sample data.

See also: [al_set_sample_instance_length], [al_get_sample_instance_time]

### API: al_set_sample_instance_length

Set the length of the sample instance in sample values. This can be used to play
only parts of the underlying sample. Be careful not to exceed the actual length
of the sample data, though.

Return true on success, false on failure.  Will fail if the sample instance is
currently playing.

See also: [al_get_sample_instance_length]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_position

Get the playback position of a sample instance.

See also: [al_set_sample_instance_position]

### API: al_set_sample_instance_position

Set the playback position of a sample instance.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_get_sample_instance_position]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_speed

Return the relative playback speed of the sample instance.

See also: [al_set_sample_instance_speed]

### API: al_set_sample_instance_speed

Set the relative playback speed of the sample instance. 1.0 means normal speed.

Return true on success, false on failure.  Will fail if the sample instance is
attached directly to a voice.

See also: [al_get_sample_instance_speed]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_gain

Return the playback gain of the sample instance.

See also: [al_set_sample_instance_gain]

### API: al_set_sample_instance_gain

Set the playback gain of the sample instance.

Returns true on success, false on failure.  Will fail if the sample instance
is attached directly to a voice.

See also: [al_get_sample_instance_gain]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_pan

Get the pan value of the sample instance.

See also: [al_set_sample_instance_pan].

### API: al_set_sample_instance_pan

Set the pan value on a sample instance.  A value of -1.0 means to play the
sample only through the left speaker; +1.0 means only through the right
speaker; 0.0 means the sample is centre balanced.
A special value [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE] disables panning and plays the
sample at its original level.  This will be louder than a pan value of 0.0.

> Note: panning samples with more than two channels doesn't work yet.

Returns true on success, false on failure.
Will fail if the sample instance is attached directly to a voice.

See also: [al_get_sample_instance_pan], [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_time

Return the length of the sample instance in seconds,
assuming a playback speed of 1.0.

See also: [al_get_sample_instance_length]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_playmode

Return the playback mode of the sample instance.

See also: [ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE], [al_set_sample_instance_playmode]

### API: al_set_sample_instance_playmode

Set the playback mode of the sample instance.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE], [al_get_sample_instance_playmode]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_playing

Return true if the sample instance is in the playing state.
This may be true even if the instance is not attached to anything.

See also: [al_set_sample_instance_playing]

### API: al_set_sample_instance_playing

Change whether the sample instance is playing.

The instance does not need to be attached to anything (since: 5.1.8).

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_get_sample_instance_playing]

### API: al_get_sample_instance_attached

Return whether the sample instance is attached to something.

See also: [al_attach_sample_instance_to_mixer],
[al_attach_sample_instance_to_voice], [al_detach_sample_instance]

### API: al_detach_sample_instance

Detach the sample instance from whatever it's attached to,
if anything.

Returns true on success.

See also: [al_attach_sample_instance_to_mixer],
[al_attach_sample_instance_to_voice], [al_get_sample_instance_attached]

### API: al_get_sample

Return the sample data that the sample instance plays.

Note this returns a pointer to an internal structure, *not* the
[ALLEGRO_SAMPLE] that you may have passed to [al_set_sample].
However, the sample buffer of the returned ALLEGRO_SAMPLE will be the same as
the one that was used to create the sample (passed to [al_create_sample]). You
can use [al_get_sample_data] on the return value to retrieve and compare it.

See also: [al_set_sample]

### API: al_set_sample

Change the sample data that a sample instance plays.  This can be quite an
involved process.

First, the sample is stopped if it is not already.

Next, if data is NULL, the sample is detached from its parent (if any).

If data is not NULL, the sample may be detached and reattached to its
parent (if any).  This is not necessary if the old sample data and new
sample data have the same frequency, depth and channel configuration.
Reattaching may not always succeed.

On success, the sample remains stopped.  The playback position and loop
end points are reset to their default values.  The loop mode remains
unchanged.

Returns true on success, false on failure.  On failure, the sample will
be stopped and detached from its parent.

See also: [al_get_sample]

### API: al_set_sample_instance_channel_matrix

Set the matrix used to mix the channels coming from this instance into the
mixer it is attached to. Normally Allegro derives the values of this matrix
from the gain and pan settings, as well as the channel configurations of this
instance and the mixer it is attached to, but this allows you override that
default value. Note that if you do set gain or pan of this instance or the
mixer it is attached to, you'll need to call this function again.

The matrix has mixer channel rows and sample channel columns, and is row major.
For example, if you have a stereo sample instance and want to mix it to a 5.1
mixer you could use this code:

~~~~c
float matrix[] = {
    0.5, 0.0, /* Half left to front left */
    0.0, 0.5, /* Half right to front right */
    0.5, 0.0, /* Half left to rear left */
    0.0, 0.5, /* Half right to rear right */
    0.1, 0.1, /* Mix left and right for center */
    0.1, 0.1, /* Mix left and right for center */
};

al_set_sample_instance_channel_matrix(instance, matrix);
~~~~

Returns true on success, false on failure (e.g. if this is not attached to a
mixer).

Since: 5.2.3

## Audio streams

### API: ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM

An ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM object is used to stream generated audio to the sound
device, in real-time. This is done by reading from a buffer, which is split
into a number of fragments. Whenever a fragment has finished playing, the
user can refill it with new data.

As with [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE] objects, streams store information necessary
for playback, so you may not play the same stream multiple times simultaneously.
Streams also need to be attached to an [ALLEGRO_MIXER], which, eventually, reaches
an [ALLEGRO_VOICE] object.

While playing, you must periodically fill fragments with new audio data. To
know when a new fragment is ready to be filled, you can either directly check
with [al_get_available_audio_stream_fragments], or listen to events from the
stream.

You can register an audio stream event source to an event queue; see
[al_get_audio_stream_event_source].  An [ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FRAGMENT]
event is generated whenever a new fragment is ready.  When you receive an
event, use [al_get_audio_stream_fragment] to obtain a pointer to the fragment
to be filled. The size and format are determined by the parameters passed to
[al_create_audio_stream].

If you're late with supplying new data, the stream will be silent until new data
is provided. You must call [al_drain_audio_stream] when you're finished with
supplying data to the stream.

If the stream is created by [al_load_audio_stream] or [al_play_audio_stream]
then it will also generate an [ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FINISHED] event if it
reaches the end of the file and is not set to loop.

### API: al_create_audio_stream

Creates an [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM]. The stream will be set to play by default.
It will feed audio data from a buffer, which is split into a number of
fragments.

Parameters:

* fragment_count - How many fragments to use for the audio stream.
    Usually only two fragments are required - splitting the audio buffer in
    two halves. But it means that the only time when new data can be supplied
    is whenever one half has finished playing.  When using many fragments,
    you usually will use fewer samples for one, so there always will be
    (small) fragments available to be filled with new data.

* frag_samples - The size of a fragment in samples. See note and explanation
    below.

* freq - The frequency, in Hertz.

* depth - Must be one of the values listed for [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH].

* chan_conf - Must be one of the values listed for [ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF].

A sample that is referred to by the *frag_samples* parameter refers to a
sequence channel intensities. E.g. if you're making a stereo stream with the
*frag_samples* set to 4, then the layout of the data in the fragment will be:

~~~~
LRLRLRLR
~~~~

Where L and R are the intensities for the left and right channels respectively.
A single sample, then, refers to the LR pair in this example.

The choice of *fragment_count*, *frag_samples* and *freq* directly influences
the audio delay. The delay in seconds can be expressed as:

    delay = fragment_count * frag_samples / freq

This is only the delay due to Allegro's streaming, there may be additional
delay caused by sound drivers and/or hardware.

> *Note:* If you know the fragment size in bytes, you can get the size in samples
> like this:
>
>     sample_size = al_get_channel_count(chan_conf) * al_get_audio_depth_size(depth);
>     samples = bytes_per_fragment / sample_size;
>
> The size of the complete buffer is:

>     buffer_size = bytes_per_fragment * fragment_count

> *Note:* Unlike many Allegro objects, audio streams are not implicitly destroyed
when Allegro is shut down.  You must destroy them manually with
[al_destroy_audio_stream] before the audio system is shut down.

### API: al_load_audio_stream

Loads an audio file from disk as it is needed.

Unlike regular streams, the one returned by this function
need not be fed by the user; the library will automatically
read more of the file as it is needed.  The stream will
contain *buffer_count* buffers with *samples* samples.

The audio stream will start in the playing state.
It should be attached to a voice or mixer to generate any output.
See [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM] for more details.

Returns the stream on success, NULL on failure.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

See also: [al_load_audio_stream_f], [al_register_audio_stream_loader],
[al_init_acodec_addon]

### API: al_load_audio_stream_f

Loads an audio file from [ALLEGRO_FILE] stream as it is needed.

Unlike regular streams, the one returned by this function
need not be fed by the user; the library will automatically
read more of the file as it is needed.  The stream will
contain *buffer_count* buffers with *samples* samples.

The file type is determined by the passed 'ident' parameter, which is a file
name extension including the leading dot.

The audio stream will start in the playing state.
It should be attached to a voice or mixer to generate any output.
See [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM] for more details.

Returns the stream on success, NULL on failure.
On success the file should be considered owned by the audio stream,
and will be closed when the audio stream is destroyed.
On failure the file will be closed.

> *Note:* the allegro_audio library does not support any audio file formats by
default.  You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.

### API: al_get_audio_stream_played_samples

Get the number of samples consumed by the parent since the audio stream was
started.

Since: 5.1.8

### API: al_get_audio_stream_fragment

When using Allegro's audio streaming, you will use this function to continuously
provide new sample data to a stream.

If the stream is ready for new data, the function will return the address
of an internal buffer to be filled with audio data.
The length and format of the buffer are specified with [al_create_audio_stream]
or can be queried with the various functions described here.
Once the buffer is filled, you must signal this to Allegro by passing the
buffer to [al_set_audio_stream_fragment].

If the stream is not ready for new data, the function will return NULL.

> *Note:* If you listen to events from the stream, an
[ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FRAGMENT] event will be generated whenever a new
fragment is ready. However, getting an event is *not* a guarantee that
[al_get_audio_stream_fragment] will not return NULL, so you still must check for it.

See also: [al_set_audio_stream_fragment], [al_get_audio_stream_event_source],
[al_get_audio_stream_frequency], [al_get_audio_stream_channels],
[al_get_audio_stream_depth], [al_get_audio_stream_length]

### API: al_set_audio_stream_fragment

Since: 5.2.8

See also: [al_init_acodec_addon], [al_identify_sample_f], [al_register_sample_identifier]

### API: al_identify_sample_f

Tries to guess the audio file type of the open ALLEGRO_FILE by
reading the first few bytes. By default Allegro cannot recognize any
file types, but calling [al_init_acodec_addon] will add detection of the
types it can read. You can also use [al_register_sample_identifier] to add
identification for custom file types.

Returns a pointer to a static string with a file extension for the
type, including the leading dot. For example ".wav" or ".ogg". Returns
NULL if the audio type cannot be determined.

Since: 5.2.8

See also: [al_init_acodec_addon], [al_identify_sample], [al_register_sample_identifier]


## Audio recording

Allegro's audio recording routines give you real-time access to raw,
uncompressed audio input streams. Since Allegro hides all of the 
platform specific implementation details with its own buffering, it will
add a small amount of latency. However, for most applications that small
overhead will not adversely affect performance.

Recording is supported by the ALSA, AudioQueue, DirectSound8, and
PulseAudio drivers. Enumerating or choosing other recording devices is not
yet supported.

### API: ALLEGRO_AUDIO_RECORDER

An opaque datatype that represents a recording device. 

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: ALLEGRO_AUDIO_RECORDER_EVENT

Structure that holds the audio recorder event data. Every event type
will contain:

* .source: pointer to the audio recorder

The following will be available depending on the event type:

* .buffer: pointer to buffer containing the audio samples
* .samples: number of samples (not bytes) that are available

Since 5.1.1

See also: [al_get_audio_recorder_event]

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_create_audio_recorder

Creates an audio recorder using the system's default recording device.
(So if the returned device does not work, try updating the system's default
recording device.)

Allegro will internally buffer several seconds of captured audio with minimal
latency. (XXX: These settings need to be exposed via config or API calls.)
Audio will be copied out of that private buffer into a fragment buffer 
of the size specified by the samples parameter. Whenever a new fragment is
ready an event will be generated.

The total size of the fragment buffer is fragment_count * samples * bytes_per_sample.
It is treated as a circular, never ending buffer. If you do not process the information
fast enough, it will be overrun. Because of that, even if you only ever need to
process one small fragment at a time, you should still use a large enough value for
fragment_count to hold a few seconds of audio.

frequency is the number of samples per second to record. Common values are:

* 8000 - telephone quality speech
* 11025
* 22050
* 44100 - CD quality music (if 16-bit, stereo)

For maximum compatibility, use a depth of ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_UINT8 or
ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT16, and a single (mono) channel.

The recorder will not record until you start it with [al_start_audio_recorder].

On failure, returns NULL.

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_start_audio_recorder

Begin recording into the fragment buffer. Once a complete fragment has been
captured (as specified in [al_create_audio_recorder]), an
[ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_RECORDER_FRAGMENT] event will be triggered.

Returns true if it was able to begin recording.

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_stop_audio_recorder

Stop capturing audio data. Note that the audio recorder is still active
and consuming resources, so if you are finished recording you should destroy
it with [al_destroy_audio_recorder].

You may still receive a few events after you call this function as the device
flushes the buffer.

If you restart the recorder, it will begin recording at the beginning of the
next fragment buffer.

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_is_audio_recorder_recording

Returns true if the audio recorder is currently capturing data and generating
events.

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_get_audio_recorder_event

Returns the event as an [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_RECORDER_EVENT].

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_get_audio_recorder_event_source

Returns the event source for the recorder that generates the various recording
events.

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_destroy_audio_recorder

Destroys the audio recorder and frees all resources associated with it. It
is safe to destroy a recorder that is recording.

You may receive events after the recorder has been destroyed. They must be
ignored, as the fragment buffer will no longer be valid.

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.


## Audio devices

### API: ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEVICE

An opaque datatype that represents an audio device.

### API: al_get_num_audio_output_devices

Get the number of available audio output devices on the system.

Since: 5.2.8

return -1 for unsupported drivers.

### API: al_get_audio_output_device

Get the output audio device of the specified index.

Since: 5.2.8

### API: al_get_audio_device_name

Get the user friendly display name of the device.

Since: 5.2.8



## Voices

### API: ALLEGRO_VOICE

A voice represents an audio device on the system, which may be a real device,
or an abstract device provided by the operating system.
To play back audio, you would attach a mixer, sample instance or audio stream to
a voice.

See also: [ALLEGRO_MIXER], [ALLEGRO_SAMPLE], [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_STREAM]

### API: al_create_voice

Creates a voice structure and allocates a voice from the digital sound driver.
The passed frequency (in Hz), sample format and channel configuration are used
as a hint to what kind of data will be sent to the voice. However, the
underlying sound driver is free to use non-matching values. For example, it may
be the native format of the sound hardware.

If a mixer is attached to the voice, the mixer will handle the conversion of
all its input streams to the voice format and care does not have to be taken
for this. However if you access the voice directly, make sure to not rely on the
parameters passed to this function, but instead query the returned voice for
the actual settings.

Reasonable default arguments are:

~~~~c
al_create_voice(44100, ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT16, ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_2)
~~~~

See also: [al_destroy_voice]

### API: al_destroy_voice

Destroys the voice and deallocates it from the digital driver.
Does nothing if the voice is NULL.

See also: [al_create_voice]

### API: al_detach_voice

Detaches the mixer, sample instance or audio stream from the voice.

See also: [al_attach_mixer_to_voice], [al_attach_sample_instance_to_voice],
[al_attach_audio_stream_to_voice]

### API: al_attach_audio_stream_to_voice

Attaches an audio stream to a voice. The same rules as
[al_attach_sample_instance_to_voice] apply. This may fail if the driver can't create
a voice with the buffer count and buffer size the stream uses.

An audio stream attached directly to a voice has a number of limitations: The
audio stream plays immediately and cannot be stopped. The stream position,
speed, gain and panning cannot be changed. At this time, we don't recommend
attaching audio streams directly to voices. Use a mixer inbetween.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_detach_voice], [al_get_voice_has_attached]

### API: al_attach_mixer_to_voice

Attaches a mixer to a voice. It must have the same frequency and channel configuration,
but the depth may be different.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_detach_voice], [al_get_voice_has_attached]

### API: al_attach_sample_instance_to_voice

Attaches a sample instance to a voice, and allows it to play. The instance's gain
and loop mode will be ignored, and it must have the same frequency, channel
configuration and depth (including signed-ness) as the voice. This function may
fail if the selected driver doesn't support preloading sample data.

At this time, we don't recommend attaching sample instances directly to voices.
Use a mixer inbetween.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_detach_voice], [al_get_voice_has_attached]

### API: al_get_voice_frequency

Return the frequency of the voice (in Hz), e.g. 44100.

### API: al_get_voice_channels

Return the channel configuration of the voice.

See also: [ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF].

### API: al_get_voice_depth

Return the audio depth of the voice.

See also: [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH].

### API: al_get_voice_playing

Return true if the voice is currently playing.

See also: [al_set_voice_playing]

### API: al_set_voice_playing

Change whether a voice is playing or not.
This can only work if the voice has a non-streaming
object attached to it, e.g. a sample instance.
On success the voice's current sample position is reset.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_get_voice_playing]

### API: al_get_voice_position

When the voice has a non-streaming object attached to it, e.g. a sample,
returns the voice's current sample position.
Otherwise, returns zero.

See also: [al_set_voice_position].

### API: al_set_voice_position

Set the voice position.  This can only work if the voice has a non-streaming
object attached to it, e.g. a sample instance.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_get_voice_position].

### API: al_get_voice_has_attached

Return true if the voice has something attached to it.

See also: [al_attach_mixer_to_voice], [al_attach_sample_instance_to_voice],
[al_attach_audio_stream_to_voice]


## Mixers

### API: ALLEGRO_MIXER

A mixer mixes together attached streams into a single buffer. In the process,
it converts channel configurations, sample frequencies and audio depths of the
attached sample instances and audio streams accordingly. You can control the
quality of this conversion using ALLEGRO_MIXER_QUALITY.

When going from mono to stereo (and above), the mixer reduces the volume of
both channels by `sqrt(2)`. When going from stereo (and above) to mono, the
mixer reduces the volume of the left and right channels by `sqrt(2)` before
adding them to the center channel (if present).

### API: ALLEGRO_MIXER_QUALITY

* ALLEGRO_MIXER_QUALITY_POINT - point sampling
* ALLEGRO_MIXER_QUALITY_LINEAR - linear interpolation
* ALLEGRO_MIXER_QUALITY_CUBIC - cubic interpolation (since: 5.0.8, 5.1.4)

### API: al_create_mixer

Creates a mixer to attach sample instances, audio streams, or other mixers to.
It will mix into a buffer at the requested frequency (in Hz) and channel count.

The only supported audio depths are ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_FLOAT32
and ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT16 (not yet complete).

To actually produce any output, the mixer will have to be attached to a voice
using [al_attach_mixer_to_voice].

Reasonable default arguments are:

~~~~c
al_create_mixer(44100, ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_FLOAT32, ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_2)
~~~~

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_destroy_mixer], [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH], [ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF]

### API: al_destroy_mixer

Destroys the mixer.

See also: [al_create_mixer]

### API: al_get_default_mixer

Return the default mixer, or NULL if one has not been set.
Although different configurations of mixers and voices can be used, in
most cases a single mixer attached to a voice is what you want.
The default mixer is used by [al_play_sample].

See also: [al_reserve_samples], [al_play_sample], [al_set_default_mixer],
[al_restore_default_mixer]

### API: al_set_default_mixer

Sets the default mixer. All samples started with [al_play_sample]
will be stopped and all sample instances returned by [al_lock_sample_id] will be
invalidated. If you are using your own mixer, this should be called before
[al_reserve_samples].

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_reserve_samples], [al_play_sample], [al_get_default_mixer],
[al_restore_default_mixer]

### API: al_restore_default_mixer

Restores Allegro's default mixer and attaches it to the default voice. If the default
mixer hasn't been created before, it will be created.
If the default voice hasn't been set via [al_set_default_voice] or created before,
it will also be created. All samples started with [al_play_sample] will be stopped
and all sample instances returned by [al_lock_sample_id] will be invalidated.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_get_default_mixer], [al_set_default_mixer], [al_reserve_samples].

### API: al_get_default_voice

Returns the default voice or NULL if there is none.

Since: 5.1.13

See also: [al_get_default_mixer]

### API: al_set_default_voice

You can call this before calling al_restore_default_mixer to provide the
voice which should be used. Any previous voice will be destroyed. You
can also pass NULL to destroy the current default voice.

Since: 5.1.13

See also: [al_get_default_mixer]

### API: al_attach_mixer_to_mixer

Attaches the mixer passed as the first argument onto the mixer passed as the
second argument. The first mixer (that is going to be attached) must not already
be attached to anything. Both mixers must use the same frequency, audio depth
and channel configuration.

Returns true on success, false on error.

It is invalid to attach a mixer to itself.

See also: [al_detach_mixer].

### API: al_attach_sample_instance_to_mixer

Attach a sample instance to a mixer.  The instance must not already be attached
to anything.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_detach_sample_instance].

### API: al_attach_audio_stream_to_mixer

Attach an audio stream to a mixer. The stream must not already be attached
to anything.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

See also: [al_detach_audio_stream].

### API: al_get_mixer_frequency

Return the mixer frequency (in Hz).

See also: [al_set_mixer_frequency]

### API: al_set_mixer_frequency

Set the mixer frequency (in Hz).  This will only work if the mixer is not

Detach the mixer from whatever it is attached to, if anything.

See also: [al_attach_mixer_to_mixer].

### API: al_set_mixer_postprocess_callback

Sets a post-processing filter function that's called after the attached
streams have been mixed. The buffer's format will be whatever the mixer
was created with. The sample count and user-data pointer is also passed.

> *Note:* The callback is called from a dedicated audio thread.



## Miscelaneous

### API: ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH

Sample depth and type as well as signedness. Mixers only use 32-bit signed
float (-1..+1), or 16-bit signed integers.
Signedness is determined by an "unsigned" bit-flag applied to the depth value.

* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT8
* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT16
* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_INT24
* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_FLOAT32
* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_UNSIGNED

For convenience:

* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_UINT8
* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_UINT16
* ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH_UINT24

### API: ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE

A special value for the pan property of sample instances and audio streams.
Use this value to disable panning on sample instances and audio streams, and play
them without attentuation implied by panning support.

ALLEGRO_AUDIO_PAN_NONE is different from a pan value of 0.0 (centered) because,
when panning is enabled, we try to maintain a constant sound power level as a
sample is panned from left to right.  A sound coming out of one speaker
should sound as loud as it does when split over two speakers.
As a consequence, a sample with pan value 0.0 will be 3 dB softer than the
original level.

(Please correct us if this is wrong.)

### API: ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF

Speaker configuration (mono, stereo, 2.1, etc).

* ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_1
* ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_2
* ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_3
* ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_4
* ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_5_1
* ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_6_1
* ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF_7_1

### API: ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE

Sample and stream playback mode.

* ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_ONCE - the sample/stream is played from start to finish an
    then it stops.
* ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP - the sample/stream is played from start to finish (or
    between the two loop points). When it reaches the end, it restarts from the
    beginning.
* ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP_ONCE - just like ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_ONCE, but
    respects the loop end point.
* ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_BIDIR - the sample is played from start to finish (or
    between the two loop points). When it reaches the end, it reverses the
    playback direction and plays until it reaches the beginning when it
    reverses the direction back to normal. This is mode is rarely supported for
    streams.

### API: ALLEGRO_AUDIO_EVENT_TYPE

Events sent by [al_get_audio_stream_event_source] or [al_get_audio_recorder_event_source].

#### ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FRAGMENT

Sent when a stream fragment is ready to be filled in. See [al_get_audio_stream_fragment].

#### ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_STREAM_FINISHED

Sent when a stream is finished.

#### ALLEGRO_EVENT_AUDIO_RECORDER_FRAGMENT

Sent after a user-specified number of samples have been recorded. Convert this to
[ALLEGRO_AUDIO_RECORDER_EVENT] via [al_get_audio_recorder_event].

You must always check the values for the buffer and samples as they
are not guaranteed to be exactly what was originally specified.

Since: 5.1.1

> *[Unstable API]:* The API may need a slight redesign.

### API: al_get_allegro_audio_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].

### API: al_get_audio_depth_size

Return the size of a sample, in bytes, for the given format. The format is one
of the values listed under [ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH].

### API: al_get_channel_count

Return the number of channels for the given channel configuration, which is one
of the values listed under [ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF].

### API: al_fill_silence

Fill a buffer with silence, for the given format and channel configuration.
The buffer must have enough space for the given number of samples,
and be properly aligned.

Since: 5.1.8
