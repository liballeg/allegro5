## About UTF-8 string routines

Some parts of the Allegro API, such as the font rountines, expect Unicode
strings encoded in UTF-8.  The following basic routines are provided to help
you work with UTF-8 strings, however it does *not* mean you need to use them.
You should consider another library (e.g. ICU) if you require more
functionality.

Briefly, Unicode is a standard consisting of a large character
set of over 100,000 characters, and rules, such as how to sort strings.
A *code point* is the integer value of a character, but not all code points are
characters, as some code points have other uses.  Unlike legacy character
sets, the set of code points is open ended and more are assigned with time.

Clearly it is impossible represent each code point with a 8-bit byte (limited
to 256 code points) or even a 16-bit integer (limited to 65536 code points).
It is possible to store code points in a 32-bit integers but it is space
inefficient, and not actually that useful (at least, when handling the full
complexity of Unicode; Allegro only does the very basics).
There exist different Unicode Transformation Formats for encoding code points
into smaller *code units*.  The most important transformation formats are
UTF-8 and UTF-16.

UTF-8 is a *variable-length encoding* which encodes each code point to
between one and four 8-bit bytes each.  UTF-8 has many nice properties, but
the main advantages are that it is backwards compatible with C strings, and
ASCII characters (code points in the range 0-127) are encoded in UTF-8
exactly as they would be in ASCII.

UTF-16 is another variable-length encoding, but encodes each code point to
one or two 16-bit words each.  It is, of course, not compatible with
traditional C strings.  Allegro does not generally use UTF-16 strings.

Here is a diagram of the representation of the word "ål", with a NUL
terminator, in both UTF-8 and UTF-16.

                       ---------------- ---------------- --------------
               String         å                l              NUL
                       ---------------- ---------------- --------------
          Code points    U+00E5 (229)     U+006C (108)     U+0000 (0)
                       ---------------- ---------------- --------------
          UTF-8 bytes     0xC3, 0xA5          0x6C            0x00
                       ---------------- ---------------- --------------
       UTF-16LE bytes     0xE5, 0x00       0x6C, 0x00      0x00, 0x00
                       ---------------- ---------------- --------------

You can see the aforementioned properties of UTF-8.  The first code point
U+00E5 ("å") is outside of the ASCII range (0-127) so is encoded to multiple
code units -- it requires two bytes.  U+006C ("l") and U+0000 (NUL) both
exist in the ASCII range so take exactly one byte each, as in a pure ASCII
string.  A zero byte never appears except to represent the NUL character, so
many functions which expect C-style strings will work with UTF-8 strings
without modification.

On the other hand, UTF-16 represents each code point by either one or two
16-bit code units (two or four bytes).  The representation of each 16-bit
code unit depends on the byte order; here we have demonstrated little endian.

Both UTF-8 and UTF-16 are self-synchronising.  Starting from any offset
within a string, it is efficient to find the beginning of the previous or
next code point.

Not all sequences of bytes or 16-bit words are valid UTF-8 and UTF-16 strings
respectively.  UTF-8 also has an additional problem of overlong forms, where
a code point value is encoded using more bytes than is strictly necessary.
This is invalid and needs to be guarded against.

In the following "ustr" functions, be careful whether a function takes code
unit (byte) or code point indices.  In general, all position parameters are
in code unit offsets.  This may be surprising, but if you think about, is
required for good performance.  (It also means some functions will work even
if they do not contain UTF-8, since they only care about storing bytes, so
you may actually store arbitrary data in the ALLEGRO_USTRs.)

For actual text processing, where you want to specify positions with code point
indices, you should use [al_ustr_offset] to find the code unit offset position.
However, most of the time you would probably just work with byte offsets.


## UTF-8 string types

### API: ALLEGRO_USTR

An opaque type representing a string.  ALLEGRO_USTRs normally contain UTF-8
encoded strings, but they may be used to hold any byte sequences, including
NULs.


### API: ALLEGRO_USTR_INFO

A type that holds additional information for an [ALLEGRO_USTR] that references
an external memory buffer.

See also: [al_ref_cstr], [al_ref_buffer] and [al_ref_ustr].


## Creating and destroying strings

### API: al_ustr_new

Create a new string containing a copy of the C-style string `s`.
The string must eventually be freed with [al_ustr_free].

See also: [al_ustr_new_from_buffer], [al_ustr_newf], [al_ustr_dup],
[al_ustr_new_from_utf16]


### API: al_ustr_new_from_buffer

Create a new string containing a copy of the buffer pointed to by `s` of the
given size in bytes.  The string must eventually be freed with [al_ustr_free].

See also: [al_ustr_new]


### API: al_ustr_newf

Create a new string using a printf-style format string.

*Notes:*

The "%s" specifier takes C string arguments, not ALLEGRO_USTRs.  Therefore to
pass an ALLEGRO_USTR as a parameter you must use [al_cstr], and it must be NUL
terminated.  If the string contains an embedded NUL byte everything from that
byte onwards will be ignored.

The "%c" specifier outputs a single byte, not the UTF-8 encoding of a code
point.  Therefore it is only usable for ASCII characters (value <= 127) or if
you really mean to output byte values from 128--255.  To insert the UTF-8
encoding of a code point, encode it into a memory buffer using
[al_utf8_encode] then use the "%s" specifier.  Remember to NUL terminate the
buffer.

See also: [al_ustr_new], [al_ustr_appendf]


### API: al_ustr_free

Free a previously allocated string.  Does nothing if the argument is NULL.

See also: [al_ustr_new], [al_ustr_new_from_buffer], [al_ustr_newf]


### API: al_cstr

Get a `char *` pointer to the data in a string.  This pointer will only be
valid while the [ALLEGRO_USTR] object is not modified and not destroyed.
The pointer may be passed to functions expecting C-style strings,
with the following caveats:

* ALLEGRO_USTRs are allowed to contain embedded NUL ('\0') bytes.
  That means `al_ustr_size(u)` and `strlen(al_cstr(u))` may not agree.

* An ALLEGRO_USTR may be created in such a way that it is not NUL terminated.
  A string which is dynamically allocated will always be NUL terminated,
  but a string which references the middle of another string or region
  of memory will *not* be NUL terminated.

* If the ALLEGRO_USTR references another string, the returned C string will
  point into the referenced string. Again, no NUL terminator will be added
  to the referenced string.

See also: [al_ustr_to_buffer], [al_cstr_dup]

### API: al_ustr_to_buffer

Write the contents of the string into a pre-allocated buffer of the given size
in bytes. The result will always be NUL terminated, so a maximum of `size - 1`
bytes will be copied.

See also: [al_cstr], [al_cstr_dup]

### API: al_cstr_dup

Create a NUL ('\0') terminated copy of the string.  Any embedded NUL
bytes will still be presented in the returned string.
The new string must eventually be freed with [al_free].

If an error occurs NULL is returned.

See also: [al_cstr], [al_ustr_to_buffer], [al_free]


### API: al_ustr_dup

Return a duplicate copy of a string.
The new string will need to be freed with [al_ustr_free].

See also: [al_ustr_dup_substr], [al_ustr_free]


### API: al_ustr_dup_substr

Return a new copy of a string, containing its contents in the byte interval
\[start_pos, end_pos).  The new string will be NUL terminated and will
need to be freed with [al_ustr_free].

If necessary, use [al_ustr_offset] to find the byte offsets for a given code
point that you are interested in.

See also: [al_ustr_dup], [al_ustr_free]


## Predefined strings

### API: al_ustr_empty_string

Return a pointer to a static empty string.  The string is read only
and must not be freed.


## Creating strings by referencing other data

### API: al_ref_cstr

Create a string that references the storage of a C-style string.  The
information about the string (e.g. its size) is stored in the structure
pointed to by the `info` parameter.  The string will not have any other
storage allocated of its own, so if you allocate the `info` structure on the
stack then no explicit "free" operation is required.

The string is valid until the underlying C string disappears.

Example:

    ALLEGRO_USTR_INFO info;
    ALLEGRO_USTR *us = al_ref_cstr(&info, "my string");

See also: [al_ref_buffer], [al_ref_ustr]


### API: al_ref_buffer

Create a string that references the storage of an underlying buffer.
The size of the buffer is given in bytes.  You can use it to reference only
part of a string or an arbitrary region of memory.

The string is valid while the underlying memory buffer is valid.

See also: [al_ref_cstr], [al_ref_ustr]


### API: al_ref_ustr

Create a read-only string that references the storage of another
[ALLEGRO_USTR] string.
The information about the string (e.g. its size) is stored in the structure
pointed to by the `info` parameter.  The new string will not have any other
storage allocated of its own, so if you allocate the `info` structure on the
stack then no explicit "free" operation is required.

The referenced interval is \[start_pos, end_pos).  Both are byte offsets.

The string is valid until the underlying string is modified or destroyed.

If you need a range of code-points instead of bytes, use [al_ustr_offset]
to find the byte offsets.

See also: [al_ref_cstr], [al_ref_buffer]


## Sizes and offsets

### API: al_ustr_size

Return the size of the string in bytes.  This is equal to the number of code
points in the string if the string is empty or contains only 7-bit ASCII
characters.

See also: [al_ustr_length]

### API: al_ustr_length

Return the number of code points in the string.

See also: [al_ustr_size], [al_ustr_offset]

### API: al_ustr_offset

Return the byte offset (from the start of the string) of the code point at
the specified index in the string. A zero index parameter will return the first
character of the string. If index is negative, it counts backward from the end
of the string, so an index of -1 will return an offset to the last code point.

If the index is past the end of the string, returns the offset of the end of
the string.

See also: [al_ustr_length]

### API: al_ustr_next

Find the byte offset of the next code point in string, beginning at `*pos`.
`*pos` does not have to be at the beginning of a code point.

Returns true on success, and the value pointed to by `pos` will be updated to
the found offset.  Otherwise returns false if `*pos` was already at the end
of the string, and `*pos` is unmodified.

This function just looks for an appropriate byte; it doesn't check if found
offset is the beginning of a valid code point.  If you are working with
possibly invalid UTF-8 strings then it could skip over some invalid bytes.

See also: [al_ustr_prev]

### API: al_ustr_prev

Find the byte offset of the previous code point in string, before `*pos`.
`*pos` does not have to be at the beginning of a code point.
Returns true on success, then value pointed to by `pos` will be updated to the
found offset.  Otherwise returns false if `*pos` was already at the end of
the string, then `*pos` is unmodified.

This function just looks for an appropriate byte; it doesn't check if found
offset is the beginning of a valid code point.  If you are working with
possibly invalid UTF-8 strings then it could skip over some invalid bytes.

See also: [al_ustr_next]


## Getting code points

### API: al_ustr_get

Return the code point in `us` beginning at byte offset `pos`.

On success returns the code point value.
If `pos` was out of bounds (e.g. past the end of the string), return -1.
On an error, such as an invalid byte sequence, return -2.

See also: [al_ustr_get_next], [al_ustr_prev_get]

### API: al_ustr_get_next

Find the code point in `us` beginning at byte offset `*pos`, then advance to
the next code point.

On success return the code point value.
If `pos` was out of bounds (e.g. past the end of the string), return -1.
On an error, such as an invalid byte sequence, return -2.
As with [al_ustr_next], invalid byte sequences may be skipped while advancing.

See also: [al_ustr_get], [al_ustr_prev_get]

### API: al_ustr_prev_get

Find the beginning of a code point before byte offset `*pos`, then return it.
Note this performs a *pre-increment*.

On success returns the code point value.
If `pos` was out of bounds (e.g. past the end of the string), return -1.
On an error, such as an invalid byte sequence, return -2.
As with [al_ustr_prev], invalid byte sequences may be skipped while advancing.

See also: [al_ustr_get_next]


## Inserting into strings

### API: al_ustr_insert

Insert `us2` into `us1` beginning at byte offset `pos`.  `pos` cannot be less
than 0.  If `pos` is past the end of `us1` then the space between the end of
the string and `pos` will be padded with NUL ('\0') bytes.

If required, use [al_ustr_offset] to find the byte offset for a given
code point index.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_insert_cstr], [al_ustr_insert_chr], [al_ustr_append],
[al_ustr_offset]

### API: al_ustr_insert_cstr

Like [al_ustr_insert] but inserts a C-style string at byte offset `pos`.

See also: [al_ustr_insert], [al_ustr_insert_chr]

### API: al_ustr_insert_chr

Insert a code point into `us` beginning at byte offset `pos`.  `pos` cannot be
less than 0. If `pos` is past the end of `us` then the space between the end of
the string and `pos` will be padded with NUL ('\0') bytes.

Returns the number of bytes inserted, or 0 on error.

See also: [al_ustr_insert], [al_ustr_insert_cstr]


## Appending to strings

### API: al_ustr_append

Append `us2` to the end of `us1`.

Returns true on success, false on error.

This function can be used to append an arbitrary buffer:

    ALLEGRO_USTR_INFO info;
    al_ustr_append(us, al_ref_buffer(&info, buf, size));

See also: [al_ustr_append_cstr], [al_ustr_append_chr], [al_ustr_appendf],
[al_ustr_vappendf]

### API: al_ustr_append_cstr

Append C-style string `s` to the end of `us`.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_append]

Append a code point to the end of `us`.

Returns the number of bytes added, or 0 on error.

See also: [al_ustr_append]

### API: al_ustr_appendf

This function appends formatted output to the string `us`.  `fmt` is a
printf-style format string.
See [al_ustr_newf] about the "%s" and "%c" specifiers.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_vappendf], [al_ustr_append]

### API: al_ustr_vappendf

Like [al_ustr_appendf] but you pass the variable argument list directly,
instead of the arguments themselves.
See [al_ustr_newf] about the "%s" and "%c" specifiers.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_appendf], [al_ustr_append]


## Removing parts of strings

### API: al_ustr_remove_chr

Remove the code point beginning at byte offset `pos`.  Returns true on success.
If `pos` is out of range or `pos` is not the beginning of a valid code point,
returns false leaving the string unmodified.

Use [al_ustr_offset] to find the byte offset for a code-points offset.

See also: [al_ustr_remove_range]

### API: al_ustr_remove_range

Remove the interval \[start_pos, end_pos) from a string.
`start_pos` and `end_pos` are byte offsets.
Both may be past the end of the string
but cannot be less than 0 (the start of the string).

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_remove_chr], [al_ustr_truncate]

### API: al_ustr_truncate

Truncate a portion of a string at byte offset `start_pos` onwards.
`start_pos` can be past the end of the string (has no effect)
but cannot be less than 0.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_remove_range], [al_ustr_ltrim_ws], [al_ustr_rtrim_ws],
[al_ustr_trim_ws]

### API: al_ustr_ltrim_ws

Remove leading whitespace characters from a string, as defined by the C
function `isspace()`.

Returns true on success, or false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_rtrim_ws], [al_ustr_trim_ws]

### API: al_ustr_rtrim_ws

Remove trailing ("right") whitespace characters from a string, as defined by
the C function `isspace()`.

Returns true on success, or false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_ltrim_ws], [al_ustr_trim_ws]

### API: al_ustr_trim_ws

Remove both leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string.

Returns true on success, or false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_ltrim_ws], [al_ustr_rtrim_ws]


## Assigning one string to another

### API: al_ustr_assign

Overwrite the string `us1` with another string `us2`.
Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_assign_substr], [al_ustr_assign_cstr]

### API: al_ustr_assign_substr

Overwrite the string `us1` with the contents of `us2` in the byte interval
\[start_pos, end_pos).  The end points will be clamed to the bounds of `us2`.

Usually you will first have to use [al_ustr_offset] to find the byte offsets.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_assign], [al_ustr_assign_cstr]

### API: al_ustr_assign_cstr

Overwrite the string `us` with the contents of the C-style string `s`.
Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_assign_substr], [al_ustr_assign_cstr]


## Replacing parts of string

### API: al_ustr_set_chr

Replace the code point beginning at byte offset `pos` with `c`.
`pos` cannot be less than 0.  If `pos` is past the end of `us1` then the space
between the end of the string and `pos` will be padded with NUL ('\0') bytes.
If `pos` is not the start of a valid code point, that is an error and
the string will be unmodified.

On success, returns the number of bytes written, i.e. the offset to the
following code point.  On error, returns 0.

See also: [al_ustr_replace_range]

### API: al_ustr_replace_range

Replace the part of `us1` in the byte interval \[start_pos, end_pos) with the
contents of `us2`.  `start_pos` cannot be less than 0.  If `start_pos` is past
the end of `us1` then the space between the end of the string and `start_pos`
will be padded with NUL ('\0') bytes.

Use [al_ustr_offset] to find the byte offsets.

Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_set_chr]


## Searching

### API: al_ustr_find_chr

See also: [al_ustr_rfind_chr]

### API: al_ustr_rfind_chr

Search for the encoding of code point `c` in `us` backwards from byte offset
`end_pos` (exclusive).
Returns the position where it is found or -1 if it is not found.

See also: [al_ustr_find_chr]

### API: al_ustr_find_set

This function finds the first code point in `us`, beginning from byte offset
`start_pos`, that matches any code point in `accept`.  Returns the position if
a code point was found.  Otherwise returns -1.

See also: [al_ustr_find_set_cstr], [al_ustr_find_cset]

### API: al_ustr_find_set_cstr

Like [al_ustr_find_set] but takes a C-style string for `accept`.

### API: al_ustr_find_cset

This function finds the first code point in `us`, beginning from byte offset
`start_pos`, that does *not* match any code point in `reject`.  In other words
it finds a code point in the complementary set of `reject`.
Returns the byte position of that code point, if any.  Otherwise returns -1.

See also: [al_ustr_find_cset_cstr], [al_ustr_find_set]

### API: al_ustr_find_cset_cstr

Like [al_ustr_find_cset] but takes a C-style string for `reject`.

See also: [al_ustr_find_cset], [al_ustr_find_set_cstr]

### API: al_ustr_find_str

Find the first occurrence of string `needle` in `haystack`, beginning from byte
offset `pos` (inclusive).  Return the byte offset of the occurrence if it is
found, otherwise return -1.

See also: [al_ustr_find_cstr], [al_ustr_rfind_str], [al_ustr_find_replace]

### API: al_ustr_find_cstr

Like [al_ustr_find_str] but takes a C-style string for `needle`.

`end_pos` (exclusive).  Return the byte offset of the occurrence if it is found,
otherwise return -1.

See also: [al_ustr_rfind_cstr], [al_ustr_find_str]

### API: al_ustr_rfind_cstr

Like [al_ustr_rfind_str] but takes a C-style string for `needle`.

offset `start_pos`.  The `find` string must be non-empty.
Returns true on success, false on error.

See also: [al_ustr_find_replace_cstr]

### API: al_ustr_find_replace_cstr

Like [al_ustr_find_replace] but takes C-style strings for `find` and `replace`.


## Comparing

### API: al_ustr_equal

Return true iff the two strings are equal.  This function is more efficient
than [al_ustr_compare] so is preferable if ordering is not important.

See also: [al_ustr_compare]

### API: al_ustr_compare

This function compares `us1` and `us2` by code point values.
Returns zero if the strings are equal, a positive number if `us1` comes after
`us2`, else a negative number.

This does *not* take into account locale-specific sorting rules.
For that you will need to use another library.

See also: [al_ustr_ncompare], [al_ustr_equal]

### API: al_ustr_ncompare

Like [al_ustr_compare] but only compares up to the first `n` code points
of both strings.

Returns zero if the strings are equal, a positive number if `us1` comes after
`us2`, else a negative number.

See also: [al_ustr_compare], [al_ustr_equal]

### API: al_ustr_has_prefix

Returns true iff `us1` begins with `us2`.

See also: [al_ustr_has_prefix_cstr], [al_ustr_has_suffix]

### API: al_ustr_has_prefix_cstr

## UTF-16 conversion

### API: al_ustr_new_from_utf16

Create a new string containing a copy of the 0-terminated string `s`
which must be encoded as UTF-16.
The string must eventually be freed with [al_ustr_free].

See also: [al_ustr_new]

### API: al_ustr_size_utf16

Returns the number of bytes required to encode the string in UTF-16
(including the terminating 0). Usually called before
[al_ustr_encode_utf16] to determine the size of the buffer to allocate.

See also: [al_ustr_size]

### API: al_ustr_encode_utf16

Encode the string into the given buffer, in UTF-16. Returns the number
of bytes written. There are never more than `n` bytes written. The
minimum size to encode the complete string can be queried with
[al_ustr_size_utf16]. If the `n` parameter is smaller than that, the
string will be truncated but still always 0 terminated.

See also: [al_ustr_size_utf16], [al_utf16_encode]


## Low-level UTF-8 routines

### API: al_utf8_width

Returns the number of bytes that would be occupied by the specified code point
when encoded in UTF-8.  This is between 1 and 4 bytes for legal code point
values.  Otherwise returns 0.

See also: [al_utf8_encode], [al_utf16_width]

### API: al_utf8_encode

Encode the specified code point to UTF-8 into the buffer `s`.  The buffer
must have enough space to hold the encoding, which takes between 1 and 4
bytes.  This routine will refuse to encode code points above 0x10FFFF.

Returns the number of bytes written, which is the same as that returned
by [al_utf8_width].

See also: [al_utf16_encode]


## Low-level UTF-16 routines

### API: al_utf16_width

Returns the number of bytes that would be occupied by the specified code
point when encoded in UTF-16. This is either 2 or 4 bytes for legal code
point values. Otherwise returns 0.

See also: [al_utf16_encode], [al_utf8_width]

### API: al_utf16_encode

Encode the specified code point to UTF-16 into the buffer `s`. The buffer
must have enough space to hold the encoding, which takes either 2 or 4
bytes. This routine will refuse to encode code points above 0x10FFFF.
