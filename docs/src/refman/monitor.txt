# Monitors

These functions are declared in the main Allegro header file:

    #include <allegro5/allegro.h>

## API: ALLEGRO_MONITOR_INFO

Describes a monitors size and position relative to other
monitors. x1, y1 will be 0, 0 on the primary display.
Other monitors can have negative values if they are to the
left or above the primary display.

    typedef struct ALLEGRO_MONITOR_INFO
    {
       int x1;
       int y1;
       int x2;
       int y2;
    } ALLEGRO_MONITOR_INFO;

## API: al_get_new_display_adapter

will be created by the calling thread, if previously set with
[al_set_new_display_adapter].
Otherwise returns `ALLEGRO_DEFAULT_DISPLAY_ADAPTER`.

## API: al_set_new_display_adapter

Sets the adapter to use for new displays created by the calling thread.
The adapter has a monitor attached to it. Information
about the monitor can be gotten using [al_get_num_video_adapters]
and [al_get_monitor_info].

To return to the default behaviour, pass `ALLEGRO_DEFAULT_DISPLAY_ADAPTER`.

Get information about a monitor's position on the desktop.
adapter is a number from 0 to al_get_num_video_adapters()-1.

## API: al_get_num_video_adapters
