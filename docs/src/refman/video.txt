# Video streaming addon

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_video.

    #include <allegro5/allegro_video.h>
    
Currently we have an ffmpeg backend and a Ogg backend (Theora + Vorbis).
The choice is fixed at compile time.
See <http://ffmpeg.org/> and <http://xiph.org/> for installation instructions,
licensing information and supported video formats.

## API: ALLEGRO_VIDEO_EVENT_TYPE

* ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FRAME_ALLOC
* ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FRAME_SHOW

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_open_video

Reads a video file. This does not start streaming yet but reads the
meta info so you can query e.g. the size or audio rate.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_close_video

Closes the video and frees all allocated resources. The video pointer
is invalid after the function returns.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_start_video

Starts streaming the video from the beginning.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_start_video_with_voice

Like [al_start_video] but audio is routed to the provided voice.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_event_source

Get an event source for the video. The possible events are described
under [ALLEGRO_VIDEO_EVENT_TYPE].

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_pause_video

Paused or resumes playback.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_is_video_paused

Returns true if the video is currently paused.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_aspect_ratio

Returns the aspect ratio of the video. Videos often do not use square
pixels so you should always check the aspect ratio before displaying
video frames.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_audio_rate

Returns the audio rate of the video, in Hz.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_fps

Returns the speed of the video in frames per second. Often this will
not be an integer value.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_width

Returns the number of pixel raw pixel columns in the video stream.
Multiply this with the aspect ratio to get the true width.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_get_video_aspect_ratio]

## API: al_get_video_height

Returns the number of rows in the video. Typically this will be
720 or 1080.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_frame

Returns the current video frame. The bitmap is owned by the video so
do not attempt to free it. The bitmap will stay valid until the next
call to al_get_video_frame.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_position

Returns the current position of the video stream in seconds since the
beginning. The parameter has the following meaning:

* 0: Return the actual position.
* 1: Return the video decoding position. If this lags behind video
     decoding is taking too long and the video can't be displayed
     properly.
* 2: Return the audio decoding position. Audio gets easily out of sync
     for some reason - but this addon does not provide any means to
     do much about it.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_seek_video

Seek to a different position in the video. Right now this does not
work very well in the ffmpeg backend when seeking backwards and will
often lose audio/video synchronization if doing so.

Since: 5.1.0
