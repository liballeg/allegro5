# Video streaming addon

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_video.

Currently we have an Ogg backend (Theora + Vorbis). See <http://xiph.org/> for
installation instructions, licensing information and supported video formats.

## API: ALLEGRO_VIDEO_EVENT_TYPE

Events sent by [al_get_video_event_source].

### ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FRAME_SHOW

This event is sent when it is time to show a new frame. Once you receive this
event, you can draw the current frame (as returned by [al_get_video_frame]).
[al_get_video_frame] will continue returning the same frame until the next
ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FRAME_SHOW is sent.

user.data1 (ALLEGRO_VIDEO *)
:   The video which generated the event.

Since: 5.1.0

### ALLEGRO_EVENT_VIDEO_FINISHED

This event is sent when the video is finished. Depending on the backend, it may
be possible to seek to an earlier part of the video and set the video to play
to resume playback.

user.data1 (ALLEGRO_VIDEO *)
:   The video which generated the event.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_TYPE

Used with [al_get_video_position] to specify which position to retrieve. If
these get out of sync, audio and video may be out of sync in the display of
the video.

* ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_ACTUAL -
The amount of time the video has been playing. If the video has audio then
this value can be ahead of ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_VIDEO_DECODE when video
decoding lags.

* ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_VIDEO_DECODE -
The amount of video that has been decoded. This may lag behind the "actual"
and audio positions if decoding is slower than realtime.

* ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_AUDIO_DECODE -
The amount of audio that has been decoded. This may be the same as
ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_ACTUAL if audio decode is driving the position,
which is common to keep audio and video in sync.

Since: 5.1.11

## API: al_init_video_addon

Initializes the video addon.

Since: 5.1.12

## API: al_is_video_addon_initialized

Returns true if the video addon is initialized, otherwise returns false.

Since: 5.2.6

## API: al_shutdown_video_addon

Shut down the video addon. This is done automatically at program exit,
but can be called any time the user wishes as well.

Since: 5.1.12

## API: al_get_allegro_video_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].

Since: 5.1.12

## API: al_open_video

Reads a video file. This does not start playing yet but reads the
meta info so you can query e.g. the size or audio rate.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_identify_video

This works exactly as [al_identify_video_f] but you specify the filename
of the file for which to detect the type and not a file handle. The
extension, if any, of the passed filename is not taken into account -
only the file contents.

Since: 5.2.8

See also: [al_init_video_addon], [al_identify_video_f]

## API: al_identify_video_f

Tries to guess the video file type of the open ALLEGRO_FILE by
reading the first few bytes. By default Allegro cannot recognize any
file types, but calling [al_init_video_addon] will add detection of the
types it can read.

Returns a pointer to a static string with a file extension for the
type, including the leading dot. For example ".ogv". Returns
NULL if the video type cannot be determined.

Since: 5.2.8

See also: [al_init_video_addon], [al_identify_video]

## API: al_close_video

Closes the video and frees all allocated resources. The video pointer
is invalid after the function returns.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_start_video

Starts playing the video from the beginning.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_start_video_with_voice

Like [al_start_video] but audio is routed to the provided voice.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_event_source

Get an event source for the video. The possible events are described
under [ALLEGRO_VIDEO_EVENT_TYPE].

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_set_video_playing

Paused or resumes playback.

Since: 5.1.12

## API: al_is_video_playing

Returns true if the video is currently playing.

Since: 5.1.12

## API: al_get_video_audio_rate

Returns the audio rate of the video, in Hz.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_fps

Returns the speed of the video in frames per second. Often this will
not be an integer value.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_video_scaled_width

Returns the width with which the video frame should be drawn. Videos often do
not use square pixels, so this will may return a value larger than the width of
the frame bitmap.

Since: 5.1.12

See also: [al_get_video_frame]

## API: al_get_video_scaled_height

Returns the height with which the video frame should be drawn. Videos often do
not use square pixels, so this will may return a value larger than the height of
the frame bitmap.

See also: [al_get_video_frame]

Since: 5.1.12

## API: al_get_video_frame

Returns the current video frame. The bitmap is owned by the video so
do not attempt to free it. The bitmap will stay valid until the next
call to al_get_video_frame.

Videos often do not use square pixels so the recommended way to draw a video
frame would be using code like this:

~~~~c
float scale = 1.0; /* Adjust this to fit your target bitmap dimensions. */
ALLEGRO_BITMAP* frame = al_get_video_frame(video);
float sw = al_get_bitmap_width(frame);
float sh = al_get_bitmap_height(frame);
float dw = scale * al_get_video_scaled_width(video);
float dh = scale * al_get_video_scaled_height(video);
al_draw_scaled_bitmap(frame, 0, 0, sw, sh, 0, 0, dw, dh, 0);
~~~~

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_get_video_scaled_width], [al_get_video_scaled_height]

## API: al_get_video_position

Returns the current position of the video stream in seconds since the
beginning. The parameter is one of the [ALLEGRO_VIDEO_POSITION_TYPE]
constants.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_seek_video

Seek to a different position in the video. Currently only seeking to the
beginning of the video is supported.

Since: 5.1.0
