# File I/O

These functions are declared in the main Allegro header file:

~~~~c
 #include <allegro5/allegro.h>
~~~~

## API: A5O_FILE

An opaque object representing an open file.  This could be a
real file on disk or a virtual file.

## API: A5O_FILE_INTERFACE

A structure containing function pointers to handle a type of "file",
real or virtual.  See the full discussion in [al_set_new_file_interface].

The fields are:

~~~~c
void*         (*fi_fopen)(const char *path, const char *mode);
bool          (*fi_fclose)(A5O_FILE *f);
size_t        (*fi_fread)(A5O_FILE *f, void *ptr, size_t size);
size_t        (*fi_fwrite)(A5O_FILE *f, const void *ptr, size_t size);
bool          (*fi_fflush)(A5O_FILE *f);
int64_t       (*fi_ftell)(A5O_FILE *f);
bool          (*fi_fseek)(A5O_FILE *f, int64_t offset, int whence);
bool          (*fi_feof)(A5O_FILE *f);
int           (*fi_ferror)(A5O_FILE *f);
const char *  (*fi_ferrmsg)(A5O_FILE *f);
void          (*fi_fclearerr)(A5O_FILE *f);
int           (*fi_fungetc)(A5O_FILE *f, int c);
off_t         (*fi_fsize)(A5O_FILE *f);
~~~~

The fi_open function must allocate memory for whatever userdata structure it needs.
The pointer to that memory must be returned; it will then be associated with the
file. The other functions can access that data by calling [al_get_file_userdata]
on the file handle. If fi_open returns NULL then [al_fopen] will also return NULL. 

The fi_fclose function must clean up and free the userdata, but Allegro will
free the [A5O_FILE] handle.

If fi_fungetc is NULL, then Allegro's default implementation of a 16 char long
buffer will be used.

## API: A5O_SEEK

* A5O_SEEK_SET - seek relative to beginning of file
* A5O_SEEK_CUR - seek relative to current file position
* A5O_SEEK_END - seek relative to end of file

See also: [al_fseek]

## API: al_fopen

Creates and opens a file (real or virtual) given the path and mode.
The current file interface is used to open the file.

Parameters:

* path - path to the file to open
* mode - access mode to open the file in ("r", "w", etc.)

Depending on the stream type and the mode string, files may be opened in
"text" mode.  The handling of newlines is particularly important.  For example,
using the default stdio-based streams on DOS and Windows platforms, where the
native end-of-line terminators are CR+LF sequences, a call to [al_fgetc] may
return just one character ('\\n') where there were two bytes (CR+LF) in the
file.  When writing out '\\n', two bytes would be written instead.
(As an aside, '\\n' is not defined to be equal to LF either.)

Newline translations can be useful for text files but is disastrous for binary
files.  To avoid this behaviour you need to open file streams in binary mode
by using a mode argument containing a "b", e.g. "rb", "wb".

Returns a file handle on success, or NULL on error.

See also: [al_set_new_file_interface], [al_fclose].

## API: al_fopen_interface

Opens a file using the specified interface, instead of the interface
set with [al_set_new_file_interface].

See also: [al_fopen]

## API: al_fopen_slice

Opens a slice (subset) of an already open random access file as if it were
a stand alone file. While the slice is open, the parent file handle must
not be used in any way.

The slice is opened at the current location of the parent file, up through
`initial_size` bytes. The `initial_size` may be any non-negative integer
that will not exceed the bounds of the parent file.

Seeking with `A5O_SEEK_SET` will be relative to this starting location.
`A5O_SEEK_END` will be relative to the starting location plus the 
size of the slice.

The mode can be any combination of:

* r: read access
* w: write access
* e: expandable
* s: seek to the end of the slice upon [al_close] (this is the default behavior)
* n: disable the seeking behavior of "s".

For example, a mode of "rw" indicates the file can be read and written. 
(Note that this is slightly different from the stdio modes.) Keep in mind
that the parent file must support random access and be open in normal
write mode (not append) for the slice to work in a well defined way.

If the slice is marked as expandable, then reads and writes can happen
after the initial end point, and the slice will grow accordingly. Otherwise,
all activity is restricted to the initial size of the slice.

A slice must be closed with [al_fclose]. The parent file will then be
positioned immediately after the end of the slice. This behavior can be
disabled by setting the "n" mode.

Since: 5.0.6, 5.1.0

## API: al_fclose

Close the given file, writing any buffered output data (if any).

Returns true on success, false on failure.
errno is set to indicate the error.

## API: al_fread

Read 'size' bytes into the buffer pointed to by 'ptr', from the given file.

Returns the number of bytes actually read.
If an error occurs, or the end-of-file is reached, the return value is a
short byte count (or zero).

al_fread() does not distinguish between EOF and other errors.
Use [al_feof] and [al_ferror] to determine which occurred.

See also: [al_fgetc], [al_fread16be], [al_fread16le], [al_fread32be],
[al_fread32le]

## API: al_fwrite

Write 'size' bytes from the buffer pointed to by 'ptr' into the given file.

Returns the number of bytes actually written.
If an error occurs, the return value is a short byte count (or zero).

See also: [al_fputc], [al_fputs], [al_fwrite16be], [al_fwrite16le],
[al_fwrite32be], [al_fwrite32le]

## API: al_fflush

Flush any pending writes to the given file.

Returns true on success, false otherwise.
errno is set to indicate the error.

See also: [al_get_errno]

## API: al_ftell

Returns the current position in the given file, or -1 on error.
errno is set to indicate the error.

On some platforms this function may not support large files.

See also: [al_fseek], [al_get_errno]

## API: al_fseek

Set the current position of the given file to a position relative
to that specified by 'whence', plus 'offset' number of bytes.

'whence' can be:

* A5O_SEEK_SET - seek relative to beginning of file
* A5O_SEEK_CUR - seek relative to current file position
* A5O_SEEK_END - seek relative to end of file

Returns true on success, false on failure.
errno is set to indicate the error.

After a successful seek, the end-of-file indicator is cleared
and all pushback bytes are forgotten.

On some platforms this function may not support large files.

See also: [al_ftell], [al_get_errno]

## API: al_feof

Returns true if the end-of-file indicator has been set on the file,
i.e. we have attempted to read *past* the end of the file.

This does *not* return true if we simply are at the end of the file.
The following code correctly reads two bytes, even when the file
contains exactly two bytes:

~~~~c
int b1 = al_fgetc(f);
int b2 = al_fgetc(f);
if (al_feof(f)) {
   /* At least one byte was unsuccessfully read. */
   report_error();
}
~~~~

See also: [al_ferror], [al_fclearerr]

## API: al_ferror

Returns non-zero if the error indicator is set on the given file,
i.e. there was some sort of previous error.
The error code may be system or file interface specific.

See also: [al_feof], [al_fclearerr], [al_ferrmsg]

## API: al_ferrmsg

Return a message string with details about the last error that occurred on
the given file handle.  The returned string is empty if there was no error,
or if the file interface does not provide more information.

See also: [al_fclearerr], [al_ferror]

## API: al_fclearerr

Clear the error indicator for the given file.

The standard I/O backend also clears the end-of-file indicator, and other
backends *should* try to do this.  However, they may not if it would require
too much effort (e.g. PhysicsFS backend), so your code should not rely on it
if you need your code to be portable to other backends.

See also: [al_ferror], [al_feof]

## API: al_fungetc

Ungets a single byte from a file.
Pushed-back bytes are not written to the file, only made available for
subsequent reads, in reverse order.

The number of pushbacks depends on the backend.  The standard I/O backend only
guarantees a single pushback; this depends on the libc implementation.

For backends that follow the standard behavior, the pushback buffer will
be cleared after any seeking or writing; also calls to [al_fseek] and [al_ftell]
are relative to the number of pushbacks. If a pushback causes the position to
become negative, the behavior of [al_fseek] and [al_ftell] are undefined.

See also: [al_fgetc], [al_get_errno]

## API: al_fsize

Return the size of the file, if it can be determined, or -1 otherwise.

## API: al_fgetc

Read and return next byte in the given file.
Returns EOF on end of file or if an error occurred.

See also: [al_fungetc]

## API: al_fputc

Write a single byte to the given file.
The byte written is the value of c cast to an unsigned char.

Parameters:

* c - byte value to write
* f - file to write to

Returns the written byte (cast back to an int) on success,
or EOF on error.

## API: al_fprintf

Writes to a file with stdio "printf"-like formatting.
Returns the number of bytes written, or a negative number
on error.

See also: [al_vfprintf]

## API: al_vfprintf

Like al_fprintf but takes a va_list. Useful for creating your own
variations of formatted printing.
Returns the number of bytes written, or a negative number
on error.

See also: [al_fprintf]

## API: al_fread16le

Reads a 16-bit word in little-endian format (LSB first).

On success, returns the 16-bit word.  On failure, returns EOF (-1).  Since -1
is also a valid return value, use [al_feof] to check if the end of the file was
reached prematurely, or [al_ferror] to check if an error occurred.

See also: [al_fread16be]

## API: al_fread16be

Reads a 16-bit word in big-endian format (MSB first).

On success, returns the 16-bit word.  On failure, returns EOF (-1).  Since -1
is also a valid return value, use [al_feof] to check if the end of the file was
reached prematurely, or [al_ferror] to check if an error occurred.

See also: [al_fread16le]

## API: al_fwrite16le

Writes a 16-bit word in little-endian format (LSB first).

Returns the number of bytes written: 2 on success, less than 2 on an error.

See also: [al_fwrite16be]

## API: al_fwrite16be

Writes a 16-bit word in big-endian format (MSB first).

Returns the number of bytes written: 2 on success, less than 2 on an error.

See also: [al_fwrite16le]

## API: al_fread32le

Reads a 32-bit word in little-endian format (LSB first).

On success, returns the 32-bit word.  On failure, returns EOF (-1).  Since -1
is also a valid return value, use [al_feof] to check if the end of the file was
reached prematurely, or [al_ferror] to check if an error occurred.

See also: [al_fread32be]

## API: al_fread32be

Read a 32-bit word in big-endian format (MSB first).

On success, returns the 32-bit word.  On failure, returns EOF (-1).  Since -1
is also a valid return value, use [al_feof] to check if the end of the file was
reached prematurely, or [al_ferror] to check if an error occurred.

See also: [al_fread32le]

## API: al_fwrite32le

Writes a 32-bit word in little-endian format (LSB first).

Returns the number of bytes written: 4 on success, less than 4 on an error.

See also: [al_fwrite32be]

## API: al_fwrite32be

Writes a 32-bit word in big-endian format (MSB first).

Returns the number of bytes written: 4 on success, less than 4 on an error.

See also: [al_fwrite32le]

## API: al_fgets

Read a string of bytes terminated with a newline or end-of-file
into the buffer given.  The line terminator(s), if any, are included in the
returned string.  A maximum of max-1 bytes are read, with one byte being
reserved for a NUL terminator.

Parameters:

* f - file to read from
* buf - buffer to fill
* max - maximum size of buffer

Returns the pointer to buf on success.  Returns NULL if an error occurred or
if the end of file was reached without reading any bytes.

See [al_fopen] about translations of end-of-line characters.

See also: [al_fget_ustr]

## API: al_fget_ustr

Read a string of bytes terminated with a newline or end-of-file.
The line terminator(s), if any, are included in the returned string.

On success returns a pointer to a new A5O_USTR structure.
This must be freed eventually with [al_ustr_free].
Returns NULL if an error occurred or if the end of file was reached without
reading any bytes.

See [al_fopen] about translations of end-of-line characters.

See also: [al_fgetc], [al_fgets]

## API: al_fputs

Writes a string to file.  Apart from the return value,
this is equivalent to:

~~~~c
al_fwrite(f, p, strlen(p));
~~~~

Parameters:

* f - file handle to write to
* p - string to write

Returns a non-negative integer on success, EOF on error.

Note: depending on the stream type and the mode passed to [al_fopen], newline
characters in the string may or may not be automatically translated to
native end-of-line sequences, e.g. CR/LF instead of LF.

See also: [al_fwrite]

## Standard I/O specific routines

### API: al_fopen_fd

Create an [A5O_FILE] object that operates on an open file descriptor using
stdio routines.  See the documentation of fdopen() for a description of the
'mode' argument.

Returns an A5O_FILE object on success or NULL on an error.
On an error, the Allegro errno will be set and the file descriptor will
not be closed.

The file descriptor will be closed by [al_fclose] so you should not
call close() on it.

See also: [al_fopen]

### API: al_make_temp_file

Make a temporary randomly named file given a filename 'template'.

'template' is a string giving the format of the generated filename and
should include one or more capital Xs.  The Xs are replaced with random
alphanumeric characters, produced using a simple pseudo-random
number generator only.  There should be no path separators.

If 'ret_path' is not NULL, the address it points to will be set
to point to a new path structure with the name of the temporary file.

Returns the opened [A5O_FILE] on success, NULL on failure.

## Alternative file streams

By default, the Allegro file I/O routines use the C library I/O routines,
hence work with files on the local filesystem, but can be overridden so that
you can read and write to other streams.  For example, you can work with blocks
of memory or sub-files inside .zip files.

There are two ways to get an [A5O_FILE] that doesn't use stdio.
An addon library may provide a function that returns a new A5O_FILE
directly, after which, all al_f* calls on that object will use
overridden functions for that type of stream.
Alternatively, [al_set_new_file_interface] changes which function will handle
the following [al_fopen] calls for the current thread.

### API: al_set_new_file_interface

Set the [A5O_FILE_INTERFACE] table for the calling thread.
This will change the handler for later calls to [al_fopen].

See also: [al_set_standard_file_interface], [al_store_state],
[al_restore_state].

### API: al_set_standard_file_interface

Set the [A5O_FILE_INTERFACE] table to the default, for the calling thread.
This will change the handler for later calls to [al_fopen].

See also: [al_set_new_file_interface]

### API: al_get_new_file_interface

Return a pointer to the [A5O_FILE_INTERFACE] table in effect
for the calling thread.

See also: [al_store_state], [al_restore_state].

### API: al_create_file_handle

Creates an empty, opened file handle with some abstract user data.
This allows custom interfaces to extend the [A5O_FILE] struct
with their own data. You should close the handle with the standard
[al_fclose] function when you are finished with it.

See also: [al_fopen], [al_fclose], [al_set_new_file_interface]

### API: al_get_file_userdata

Returns a pointer to the custom userdata that is attached to the
file handle. This is intended to be used by functions that extend
[A5O_FILE_INTERFACE].
