# Touch input

These functions are declared in the main Allegro header file:

~~~~c
 #include <allegro5/allegro.h>

## API: A5O_TOUCH_INPUT

An abstract data type representing a physical touch screen or touch pad.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: A5O_TOUCH_INPUT_MAX_TOUCH_COUNT

The maximum amount of simultaneous touches that can be detected.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: A5O_TOUCH_STATE

This is a structure that is used to hold a "snapshot" of a touch at
a particular instant.

Public fields (read only):

* id - identifier of the touch. If the touch is valid, this is positive.
* x - touch x position
* y - touch y position
* dx - touch relative x position
* dy - touch relative y position
* primary - TRUE if this touch is the primary one (usually the first one).
* display - The [A5O_DISPLAY] that was touched.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: A5O_TOUCH_INPUT_STATE

This is a structure that holds a snapshot of all simultaneous touches at a
particular instant.

Public fields (read only):

* touches - an array of [A5O_TOUCH_STATE]

Since: 5.1.0

## API: A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_MODE

Type of mouse emulation to apply.

A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_NONE
:   Disables mouse emulation.

A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_TRANSPARENT
:   Enables transparent mouse emulation.

A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_INCLUSIVE
:   Enable inclusive mouse emulation.

A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_EXCLUSIVE
:   Enables exclusive mouse emulation.

A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_5_0_x
:   Enables mouse emulation that is backwards compatible with Allegro 5.0.x.

Since: 5.1.0

> *[Unstable API]:* Seems of limited value, as touch input tends to have different
semantics compared to mouse input.

## API: al_install_touch_input

Install a touch input driver, returning true if successful.  If a
touch input driver was already installed, returns true immediately.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_uninstall_touch_input]

## API: al_uninstall_touch_input

Uninstalls the active touch input driver. If no touch input driver was active,
this function does nothing.

This function is automatically called when Allegro is shut down.

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [al_install_touch_input]

## API: al_is_touch_input_installed

Returns true if [al_install_touch_input] was called successfully.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_get_touch_input_state

Gets the current touch input state. The touch information is copied into the
[A5O_TOUCH_INPUT_STATE] you provide to this function.

Since: 5.1.0

## API: al_set_mouse_emulation_mode

Sets the kind of mouse emulation for the touch input subsystem to perform.

Since: 5.1.0

> *[Unstable API]:* Seems of limited value, as touch input tends to have different
semantics compared to mouse input.

See also: [A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_MODE], [al_get_mouse_emulation_mode].

## API: al_get_mouse_emulation_mode

Returns the kind of mouse emulation which the touch input subsystem is
set to perform.

Since: 5.1.0

> *[Unstable API]:* Seems of limited value, as touch input tends to have different
semantics compared to mouse input.

See also: [A5O_MOUSE_EMULATION_MODE], [al_set_mouse_emulation_mode].

## API: al_get_touch_input_event_source

Returns the global touch input event source.  This event source generates
[touch input events][A5O_EVENT_TOUCH_BEGIN].

Since: 5.1.0

See also: [A5O_EVENT_SOURCE], [al_register_event_source]

## API: al_get_touch_input_mouse_emulation_event_source

Returns the global touch input event source for emulated mouse events.
This event source generates [emulated mouse events][A5O_EVENT_MOUSE_AXES]
that are based on touch events.

See also: [A5O_EVENT_SOURCE], [al_register_event_source]

Since: 5.1.0

> *[Unstable API]:* Seems of limited value, as touch input tends to have different
semantics compared to mouse input.
