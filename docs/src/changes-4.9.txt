-  Some OpenGL bitmap routines were not checking whether the target bitmap was
   locked.

-  Fixed a bug where al_map_rgb followed by al_unmap_rgb would return
   different values.

-  Fixed problems with sub-sub-bitmaps.

   coordinates specified by the user with al_set_new_window_position().

-  Made is_wgl_extension_supported() fail gracefuly.

-  Added ALLEGRO_ALPHA_TEST bitmap flag.

-  Minor optimizations in some memory blitting routines.

Input:

-  Replaced (ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE *) casting with type-safe functions, namely
   al_get_keyboard_event_source, al_get_mouse_event_source,
   al_get_joystick_event_source, al_get_display_event_source,
   al_get_timer_event_source, etc.

   ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE.  al_create_user_event_source() is replaced by
   al_init_user_event_source().

   tabbing away from a window.

Peter Wang.

General:

-  Lots of bug fixes.

File system hooks:

-  Rationalised file system hook functions.  Failure reasons can be retrieved
   with al_get_errno().

-  Enable large file support on 32-bit systems.

-  Converted the library and addons to use file system hook functions.

Path functions:

   internally, which is distributed under a BSD licence.  Allegro 5 will
   expect all strings to be either ASCII compatible, or in UTF-8 encoding.

   removed.)

Config routines:

-  Clarified behaviour of al_config_add_comment, al_config_set_value with
   regards to whitespace and leading comment marks.

   cannot be set rather than falling back to a windowed mode.

-  Added a field to the mouse state struct to indicate the display the mouse is
   currently on.

   type new to DirectInput 8.

-  Updated ex_get_path example.

-  Made ex_ttf accept the TTF file name on the command line.

Build system:

-  Use official CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE method of selecting which build configuration.
   This should work better for non-make builds, however, it's no longer
   possible to build multiple configurations with a single configuration step
   as we could previously.

Removals:

-  Remove outdated A4 tools.

-  Remove icodec addon.

-  SCons build was unmaintained and not working.

   and overhead statistics to exnew_timer.

   event masking was probably not very useful anyway. In all, the
   functions removed are: al_event_source_mask, al_event_source_set_mask,

   required event types to be bitfields.

   area with the gui_bg_color.

-  Added CMake and SCons build systems. These are mainly for use by Allegro
   developers at present.

Changes from 4.2 series to 4.9.0 (July 2006)
============================================

*Note that 4.9.0 was called 4.3.0 when it was originally released.*

Basically we're just wrapping up what we have in version control up to
now.  See the commit logs if you want details.

This release introduces a few new subsystems.  We have an event system, a
new keyboard API, a new joystick API, a new timer API, and the start of a
new graphics API.  All of these are subject to change, as is usual for
a WIP.

We are maintaining a certain level of source compatibility with the 4.2
API.  If it's easy to maintain compatibility then we do it, otherwise
compatibility is dropped.  Obscure features are more likely to be dropped.

This release has had minimal testing on Linux/x86, Windows/x86 (MinGW) and
Windows/x86 (MSVC).  It seems to work on some Linux/x86-64 machines also.
Other ports are broken or untested.

The new functions are as follows (in no particular order).  No real
documentation exists at the moment but interesting header files
are: altime.h, display.h, draw.h, events.h, joystick.h, keyboard.h,
