text=Welcome to the Allegro demonstration game, by Shawn Hargreaves.                                Your mission: to go where noone has gone before, to seek out strange new life, and to boldly blast it to smithereens.                                Your controls: the arrow keys to move left and right, the up arrow to accelerate (the faster you go, the more score you get), and the space bar to fire.                                What complexity!                                What subtlety.                                What originality.                                But enough of that. On to the serious stuff...                                -------- Introduction --------                                Allegro is a cross-platform library intended for use in computer games and other types of multimedia programming. It was initially conceived on the Atari ST, but that platform sadly died during childbirth. After a brief stay with Borland C, it was adopted by the fantastic djgpp compiler, where it grew to maturity. In the fullness of time it gave birth to children of its own, who went to live in such exotic locations as DirectX and the X Server, but the entire family is now back together again, living in harmony as a single portable entity. How about that for a mixture of metaphors? :-)                                  A wide range of extension packages and add-on modules are also available, which can be found in the "Library Extensions" section of the Allegro.cc website, http://www.allegro.cc/.                                  According to the Oxford Companion to Music, Allegro is the Italian for "quick, lively, bright". It is also a recursive acronym which stands for "Allegro Low Level Game Routines".                                  -------- Features --------                                Cross-platform support for DOS, Windows, Unix, BeOS, QNX and MacOS X systems.                                  Drawing functions including putpixel, getpixel, lines, rectangles, flat shaded, gouraud shaded, texture mapped, and z-buffered polygons, circles, floodfill, bezier splines, patterned fills, masked, run length encoded, and compiled sprites, blitting, bitmap scaling and rotation, translucency/lighting, and text output with proportional fonts. Supports clipping, and can draw directly to the screen or to memory bitmaps of any size.                                  DOS graphics drivers for VGA mode 13h, mode-X (twenty three tweaked VGA resolutions plus unchained 640x400 Xtended mode), and SVGA modes with 8, 15, 16, 24, and 32 bit color depths, taking full advantage of VBE 2.0 linear framebuffers and the VBE/AF hardware accelerator API if they are available. Additional video hardware support is available from the FreeBE/AF project (http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/freebe/).                                  Windows graphics drivers using DirectX in fullscreen and windowed modes, plus routines for drawing onto GDI device contexts.                                  Unix graphics drivers for X, DGA2, fbcon, SVGAlib, VBE/AF, mode-X, and standard VGA.                                  BeOS graphics drivers using BWindowScreen in fullscreen and BDirectWindow in windowed modes.                                  MacOS X native graphics drivers using CGDirectDisplay API for direct fullscreen gfx access and QuickDraw in a Cocoa window in windowed mode.                                  Hardware scrolling and triple buffering (where available), mode-X split screens, and palette manipulation.                                  FLI/FLC animation player.                                  Plays background MIDI music and up to 64 simultaneous sound effects, and can record sample waveforms and MIDI input. Samples can be looped (forwards, backwards, or bidirectionally), and the volume, pan, pitch, etc, can be adjusted while they are playing. The MIDI player responds to note on, note off, main volume, pan, pitch bend, and program change messages, using the General MIDI patch set and drum mappings. DOS version currently supports Adlib, SB, SB Pro, SB16, AWE32, MPU-401, ESS AudioDrive, Ensoniq Soundscape, and Windows Sound System. Windows version supports WaveOut and DirectSound interfaces and the system MIDI drivers. Unix version supports OSS, ESD, and ALSA sound drivers. BeOS version supports BSoundPlayer and BMidiSynth interfaces. MacOS X native version supports CoreAudio, Carbon Sound Manager and QuickTime Note Allocator interfaces. All versions provide software wavetable MIDI playback.                                  Easy access to the mouse, keyboard, joystick, and high resolution timer interrupts, including a vertical retrace interrupt simulator in the DOS version.                                  Routines for reading and writing LZSS compressed files.                                  Multi-object data files and a grabber utility.                                  Math functions including fixed point arithmetic, lookup table trig, and 3d vector/matrix/quaternion manipulation.                                  GUI dialog manager and file selector.                                  Built-in support for 16-bit and UTF-8 format Unicode characters.                                  -------- Copyright --------                                Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do not have to give us anything in return. However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that other people can learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.                                  Disclaimer:                                  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

There are three mailing lists for Allegro-related discussion, each with a slightly different purpose.                                  [AL] - Allegro main - http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/alleg-main/.                                  This list is for any kind of discussion about Allegro, questions about Allegro, reports of problems with Allegro, suggestions for new features, announcements of programs written using Allegro, etc. General rule: if it has to do with Allegro, you can post it here. If not, go somewhere else (for example comp.os.msdos.djgpp, comp.lang.c, or the online forums at http://www.allegro.cc/).                                  [AD] - Allegro developers - http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/alleg-developers/.                                  This list is for the people currently working on Allegro, who use it to coordinate their efforts. You can use this address if you need to contact the developers directly, for example to submit some new code that you have written or to report a bug.                                  Unlike the other lists, we will be really rude to people who post inappropriate material here, so please don't do that! Do not send tech-support questions to this list. Don't post bug reports here unless you are 100% certain they aren't your fault (if you are in any doubt, use the main Allegro list instead, which is read by most of the same people who are subscribed here).                                  The Allegro development is a completely open process, and everyone is welcome to drop by, have a listen, and start contributing code patches. This list is for working rather than talking, though, so please don't do anything that might get in our way.                                  [Alleg5] - Allegro 5 - http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/alleg-bigfive.                                  This list was once available for discussing the next major version of Allegro, when it was too noisy to do so on [AD]. This is no longer the case so the list has been shut down. However, its archives are still valuable.                                  To subscribe to one of the three lists, simply go to it's web page and use the online forms to subscribe yourself. You can remove yourself from a list going to the same page above, which can be used to remind you of your password too, in case you have forgotten it.                                  To send a message to one of the lists, write to alleg-main@lists.sourceforge.net or alleg-developers@lists.sourceforge.net. You don't need to be subscribed to these mailing lists before you can post there, but it is a good idea to subscribe in order to see the replies.                                  Before posting tech-support questions to the Allegro list, please take a moment to read the guidelines in docs/txt/help.txt. See docs/txt/ahack.txt for information about the style of code we use, and how to create your patches.                                  If you want to search through the archives of any of those mailing lists, you will have to check the available options at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/maillist.html.                                  Please don't send messages in HTML format. The increased size places an unnecessary load on the server, and many subscribers have a hard time reading these posts.                                  Please do not crosspost between these lists. Choose the most appropriate one for your message, and then send it only to that list.                                  Please don't send large binary attachments to any of the lists, they will be rejected by the size limit filter, which is set to 100KB for the developers mailing list, and 40KB for the others. Upload your files to a website and then post the URL, or if you can't do that, post an announcement asking people to write to you privately, and then send the file by individual email to whoever responded.                                  Please use English in your messages. You could eventually post messages in whatever language you prefer, but that would terribly limit the chances of getting a useful answer.                                  Remember that the RFC 1855: netiquette guidelines (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt) describes other general guidelines you should follow as a correct internet user (in mailing lists and other places as well), and provides more verbose descriptions and explanations about why you should follow the above guidelines.                                  One of the important guidelines you should be aware of is how to quote correctly the message you are replying to. The previous RFC doesn't really explain how to do it, so you might want to read the document "How do I quote correctly in Usenet?" at http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html. Quoting correctly is easier to say than to do, especially for users of Microsoft Outlook. If you are such a user, you can help yourself using the Outlook-QuoteFix extension written by Dominik Jain, which you can find at http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/.
