/* Creates an instance of the screenshot structure and initializes it. The user
   should call this function somewhere at the beginning of the program and
   use the value it returns to take screenshots. This function makes sure
   previously made screenshots will not be overwritten.

   Parameters:
      char *name - the base of the name for the screenshots; actual names
                   will have their number appended to them; typically the name
                   should have no more than 4 characters (for compatibility)
      char *ext - extension of the screenshot bitmaps; typically this should
                  be either bmp, pcx, tga or lbm, anything else will fail to
                  produce screenshots unless you have and addon library that
		  integrates itself with save_bitmap()

   Returns:
      SCREENSHOT *ss - an instance of the SCREENSHOT structure

      SCREENSHOT *ss - a pointer to an SCREENSHOT object

   Returns:

   Parameters:

      A5O_BITMAP *buffer - the bitmap from which we take a screenshot; this can be
                       the screen bitmap but taking screenshots from video
		       bitmaps like the screen is a bit slower so if you use a
		       memory double buferring system you should pass your
		       buffer to this function instead

   Returns:
