	Level loading related variables -

	Lines is a count of the number of lines of text that have been parsed from
	the source level file. It is used for error reporting where necessary.

	Error is an error flag. If it is set to non-zero then some error occurred.

	ErrorText is a textual description of the error that has occurred in level
	loading. It is set initially to be an empty string, and if an error is
	flagged but an error string not provided then the user gets an "Unspecified
	error"

		TK_CLOSEBRACE	- the } character
		TK_COMMA		- the , character

		TK_STRING		- a section of text enclosed in quotes, e.g. "hello"
		TK_NUMBER		- a number in any C standard format, integer or
						floating point (e.g. 97, 012, 0x8 or 23.6f)
		TK_COMMENT		- a comment, which begins with a hash and then runs
						to the end of line

		TK_UNKNOWN		- something the parser didn't really understand
