   Added the D_DIRTY flag and mouse button press/release events to the GUI

   conversions of the palette table, added scare_mouse_area(), added the
   yield_timeslice() function, added the update selection function to the
   grabber, added the XCRP and YCRP properties to datafiles in general,
   implemented the big header split and did plenty of other things too.
