[graphics]

# Can be 'default', 'opengl' or 'direct3d' (Windows only).

# Display configuration selection mode.
#
# Under Linux, it can be used to force the old GLX 1.2 way of choosing
# display settings or the new FBConfig method introduced with GLX 1.3.
#
# Under Windows, when using the OpenGL driver, setting it to old will
# use DescribePixelFormat and new will use wglGetPixelFormatAttribivARB
# (provided by WGL_ARB_pixel_format extension).
#
# Can be 'old' and 'new'. Default is 'new'.
config_selection=new

# What method to use to detect legacy cards for the Direct3D backend of the
# primitives addon. Can be 'default', which means it'll check that the pixel
# shader version supported is below some value. 'force_legacy' will force it to
# detect as a legacy card. 'force_modern' will force it to detect is as a modern
# card.
prim_d3d_legacy_detection=default

# For compatibility reasons, video bitmaps smaller than this size are
# backed by textures with this size. This is often no longer necessary
# on more modern systems, and should be set to < 16 if you're creating
# bitmaps smaller than this size. Note that on Android, this is ignored
# if smaller than 32.

[audio]

[oss]

# You can skip probing for OSS4 driver by setting this option to 'yes'.
# Default is 'no'.

# When OSS3 is used, you can choose a sound device here.
# Default is '/dev/dsp'.

[opengl_disabled_extensions]

# GL_EXT_framebuffer_object=0

[image]

# Gamma handling of PNG files.
# A value of 0.0 means: Don't do any gamma correction.
# A value of -1.0 means: Use the value from the environment variable
# SCREEN_GAMMA (if available), otherwise fallback to a value of 2.2
# (a good guess for PC monitors, and the value for sRGB colourspace).
# Otherwise, the value is taken as-is.

[joystick]

# Linux: Allegro normally searches for joystick device N at /dev/input/jsN.
# You can override the device file path on a per-device basis, like this.

# device0=/dev/input/by-id/usb-blahblah-joystick

# Windows: You can choose between the XINPUT or DIRECTINPUT driver for
# joysticks and force feedback joysticks. Xinput is the more modern 
# system, but DirectInput has more force feedback capabilities for older 
# joysticks.

# Windows: Use this to force an XInput DLL version, example "3" forces
# xinput1_3.dll. By default, the latest version is used.

[keyboard]

# You can trap/untrap the mouse cursor within a window with a key combination
# of your choice, e.g. "Ctrl-G", "Shift-Ctrl-G", "Ctrl-LShift", "RWin".
# This feature currently only works on X11 and Windows.

# toggle_mouse_grab_key = ScrollLock

# By default, you can press Ctrl-Alt-Delete or Ctrl-Alt-End to quit Allegro
# programs. Set this to false to disable this feature. This only works on
# Linux.

# enable_three_finger_exit = true

# By default, pressing the LED toggling keys (e.g. CapsLock) will also toggle
# the LED on the keyboard. Setting this to false disable that connection.
# This can only be controled on non-X11 Linux.

# enable_key_led_toggle = true


[trace]
# Comma-separated list of channels to log. Default is "all" which

# Channel names can be prefixed with - to exclude only those channels.
# Each addon and source-file can define additional channels though so
# there are more.

# Log-level. Can be one of debug, info, warn, error, none or empty.
# In debug builds if it is empty or unset, then the level is set to debug.
# In release builds if it is empty or unset, then the level is set to none.
# If not none, Allegro will write out the logs to an allegro.log file next to
# the binary. Use ALLEGRO_TRACE environment variable to control that file
# location. A special filename of - (dash) means logging to stdout.

[compatibility]

# Prior to 5.2.4 on Windows you had to manually resize the display when
